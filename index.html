      <h1>Wolf Gear Mags</h1>
      I'm purchasing a design studio program for $135 (tax included) to create a magazine. Since I've used their software before and find it reliable, I'd like to split the payment with my friends as a holiday gift. Do you have anything you can contribute to support this cause?
