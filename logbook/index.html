This logbook was developed because Trello decided to lock me out of my account. Within this logbook you will find any and all project updates. Updates will only include published content to ensure that you will be able ot find things more easily. If you want to see things in development then you may join my discord or you may direct message me as <span><a>@osyra42</a></span>.
