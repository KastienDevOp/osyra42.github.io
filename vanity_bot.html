            <h2>About Vanity</h2>
            <p>
              Vanity has been a passion project since about 2017.<br />
              The concept: "How ridiculous can a discord bot be?"

            <h3>EDIT 09/13/2024</h3>
            <p>
              Vanity has been upgraded to its next major version, Garlic, continuing the playful tradition of naming
              major rewrites after vegetables. This update introduces a new model called DarkIdol, powered by Ollama,
              which offers a faster backend for enhanced processing capabilities.
            </p>

            <h3>Main Features</h3>
            <p>
              Vanity's current version utilizes an advanced, uncensored language model (LLM) to generate responses,
              ensuring a nuanced and accurate communication style. Integrated with a sophisticated voice model, this
              iteration goes beyond textual interaction by audibly delivering responses on Discord. This dual capability
              not only enhances engagement but also adds a dynamic layer to the platform's functionality. Users benefit
              from a more immersive experience where spoken responses complement textual ones, enriching the overall
              interaction and usability of Vanity significantly.
            </p>

            <h3>Minecraft History</h3>
            <p>
              In historical versions, Vanity had the capability to connect to any vanilla Minecraft server using
              <a href="https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer" target="_blank">mineflayer.js</a>
              and interact with players using commands sent to her in discord. Plans were in place to advance its
              functionality to procedurally understand player actions and offer assistance. However, the Minecraft 1.13
              <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_1.13/Flattening" target="_blank">Flattening</a>
              update rendered the bot incompatible, leading to its functionality breaking down. With the popularity of
              the new update among players who were testing the bot, I redirected development efforts towards
              implementing different features. Unfortunately, this update, with its promising advancements, became a
              lost chapter in Vanity's development history.
            </p>
            <p>
              Until the recent surge in AI development brought new potential to this part of the project, there was
              little progress. However, a new tool,
              <a href="https://github.com/kolbytn/mindcraft" target="_blank">mindcraft.js</a>, offers a fresh approach
              to using Mineflayer. Although I have explored this application, it currently does not meet the community's
              needs. Specifically, the bot cannot utilize the Minecraft Forge Protocol for connections, which is a
              critical requirement for our purposes. Additionally, the bot would rely on
              <a href="https://chatgpt.com" target="_blank">ChatGPT+</a> but I wanted the project to remain local,
              avoiding reliance on external services to maintain control and privacy. Consequently, this update still
              does not bring Vanity back into the game.
            </p>
            <h3>Chat Features</h3>
            <p>
              In Vanity's earlier versions, I incorporated text recognition using regular expressions (regex) to detect
              cussing. When Vanity identified inappropriate language, she would humorously overreact by calling the user
              names, all in good fun. This playful, sassy personality significantly increased user engagement, making
              interactions with Vanity more entertaining and memorable. These humorous responses and interactions were
              instrumental in setting up a personality for later AI development, highlighting the potential of AI to
              create dynamic and engaging user experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              I tried various hype models, including
              <a href="https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B" target="_blank">Llama3 8B</a>
              and
              <a href="https://huggingface.co/solidrust/Llama-3-8B-Lexi-Uncensored-AWQ" target="_blank">Lexi Llama3</a>
              (uncensored version), but they either didn't work, were incompatible with my library, or were excessively
              censored. After several unsuccessful attempts with these models, I decided to revisit Nous Hermes. Given
              the passage of time, I discovered a new model:
              <a href="https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-SOLAR-10.7B" target="_blank"
                >Nous Hermes 2 Solar</a
              >. This model offered a fresh opportunity to enhance Vanity's capabilities while preserving her unique,
              engaging personality.
            </p>
            <h3>Speech Synthesis</h3>
            <p>
              While not the cleanest implementation, I integrated speech capability into Vanity using OpenVoice, a
              versatile voice cloning tool. This addition, despite lacking a detailed history, involved experimenting
              with approximately a dozen different voices. Despite its relatively brief implementation period, I believe
              it's significant enough to warrant discussion. This enhancement allowed Vanity to audibly communicate
              responses, adding a new dimension to user interactions. While the journey with
              <a href="https://github.com/myshell-ai/OpenVoice" target="_blank">OpenVoice</a>
              is still unfolding, its impact on Vanity's functionality and user experience is noteworthy, demonstrating
              the ongoing evolution of AI-driven interactions.
