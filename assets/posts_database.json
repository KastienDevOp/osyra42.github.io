      "content": "I have converted a few pages to the new look and I have to say it is pretty. I have also deleted a lot of pages so if you get dead links let me know I will show you where the data is. (No data was lost) The leaves that are falling are going to become their own library called Clutter and will get a few error fixes and patches before being publicly available on github and here. The back end has been cleaned up significantly. I will add a link to the backrooms, it will never get an update, but things may be moved from the backrooms to the main site making them clean.",

      "content": "I have started to work on tons of bug fixes on the website some visible and tons invisible. To get started I have simplified the sidebar with links, added a divider and attached each link to a page, a couple pages still point to the old layout, I will be fixing that in the next couple weeks, I have been struggling to decide on what is the best way to process data to the page. That would be one of the invisible updates. Let's talk about a few viable things, I have been trying to implement relative time to each post so you can see how long ago the post was made instead of seeing exact date time. The Bug tracker is legitimately posted to the side panel now. It does still take you to the backrooms but that will be fixed eventually. And finally the last thing I will report here is that the Loot Game has gotten traction, you can see the notes below.",
