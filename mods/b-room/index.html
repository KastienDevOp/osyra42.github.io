Nightly Bathroom Cleaning Procedures

Sweeping the Front End and Produce:

When someone sweeps, they should always have a scraper of some sort with them to scrape up stickers, gum, and loosen up any dirt that can then be swept. It is best to use a stick scraper, that way you don't have to keep bending over to scrape stuff off the floor. Sweep around and in between all of the registers and self-checkout, also including behind the registers in Customer Service. Sweep all of the produce sales floor and be sure to get any leaves/ stems that are on the floor by the Wet Wall (where the fresh vegetables are sold). Once that is done (which you may have to go back over these areas once customers leave), the Vestibules (or entrances) both need to be swept. It is best to sweep after you vacuum and roll up the rugs, that way, nothing is in your way when you have to sweep. Be sure to pick up and shake off the rubber mats where the People Greeting Associates stand (also do this before you sweep). Remember, you are sweeping for whoever has to scrub those areas for that night. so please do your best.

Vacuuming the Rugs and Carpets:

Use the vacuum from the maintenance area and clean the rugs and carpet in the following areas; the TLE register rug needs vacuumed and rolled up (The ones inside the Auto Care Center do not need to be vacuumed, but make sure there is no trash lying on the floor.), the carpet behind the registers in pharmacy, ALL of the rugs in BOTH Vestibules need to be vacuumed and rolled up except for the ones in front of the Ice Freezers (those just need vacuumed), the rugs behind the registers in Customer Service just need to be vacuumed, the rug in Produce (if there is one in front of the Wet Wall), the rug in front of the Water Filling Machine needs vacuumed and rolled up, and finally be sure to vacuum the rug in the "Spark" room (The room by maintenance that has an armchair in it).

Replacing the Liners of Trashcans Inside the Store:

Pretty much anywhere there is a trashcan, check to see if it is full, smells, or has something in it that needs thrown away, tie off the top of the liner, put it in the large, gray trash bin, replace the liner with a liner of the same size, and move on. The only places you should not have to go is past the gate in the ACC, and in the Bakery/ Produce/ Meat backroom. Also be careful not to throw any of the bags with oil-soaked rags from the ACC, and no compressed gas canisters into the compactor (Ask someone if you are not sure what you can/ can't throw away).

Cleaning the Breakroom and Offices:

The best time to clean the breakroom is sometime after 5:00 am. (After all the 5 o'clock people get to work, and late enough in the morning so that it will appear clean when the managers come in for the day). Both of the microwaves need cleaned out, the sink and countertop need wiped down and sanitized, the doors and handles (including the refrigerators and microwaves) need wiped down and need wiped down and sanitized, and then the floor needs swept and mopped. The same procedure goes for the Manager's office, the Personnel office, the UPC office (right next to maintenance), and the "Spark room. Doors and handles need wiped down and sanitized, windows need cleaned (if there are any visible smudges), countertops need wiped down and sanitized, and sweep and mop the floors (You don't have to mop the "Spark" room).

Cleaning the Restrooms:

There are 6 restrooms around the store including the men's and women's restrooms up front, the men's

and women's restrooms in the back, the family restroom in the back, and the bathroom in the ACC. There is a small box under the register counter with a button on the back that you need to press to unlock the ACC. Make sure that the timer (the knob on the side) for the the door is set long enough for you to go over and open it. You cannot open the door by turning the handle, so just pull the door open, and it is automatically unlocked if you push it from the other side. Be sure to place the "Bathroom Closed for Maintenance" sign in front of the bathroom when you are in there. Always ask if there is anyone in the bathroom of the opposite of your sex (This could save your life!). Check the dispensers of the bathroom first; the soap dispensers, the paper towel holders, the toilet paper holders, the half-fold toilet seat cover holders, and the wax paper liners in the women's and family restrooms (Be sure to open all of these with the key, and the tool provided on the bathroom cart.) Then start cleaning each of the toilets and urinals. Clean the inside wall of the urinal by spraying the disinfectant cleaner, and wipe down the edges and bottom (where the bend is). Wipe off the dividers separating the urinals and the wall behind the urinals too (Look for any stains or visible marks). Then clean the stalls by wiping the toilet paper, half fold toilet seat cover, and wax paper liner holders first. Then, spray down the back of the bowl, the top of the toilet seat, the bottom of the toilet seat and the edge of the bowl with the disinfectant. Wipe all of the cleaner that you sprayed onto the toilet off (Wipe off the stainless steel box on top of the toilet first.), then try to wipe any fecal matter off of the walls behind, in front, and the sides of the stall. If you need to, use a toilet-bowl brush to clean under the rim of the toilet bowl, and wipe off the front and sides of the the toilet, under the bowl. Once that is done, clean the mirrors, the handsoap dispensers, the inside of each sink, the faucets, and the counter. Don't forget to clean the wall under the handsoap dispensers. Wipe off the top of the paper towel holder and start polishing all of the stainless steel dispensers and holders in the bathrooms; the baby-changing station, the small diaper trashcan (in the wall), the diaper dispenser, the hand driers, and the tampon dispensers in the women's and family restrooms (The stainless steel toilet paper holders should have been wiped off when you where cleaning the stalls). Finally, check the walls for any fecal matter/ smears or stains and try your best to clean them off. Then sweep the floor, and mop (Be sure to put down a "Wet Floor" sign in the an entrance of the bathroom). Clean each of the doors and handles of every bathroom (inside and out). wipe down the walls behind the water fountains, and wipe down the water fountains themselves.

This list WILL take all night long to complete. You will not be asked to do anything else as long as every task is done to the best of your abilities. Thank you. -Clean Team Lead Nathan
