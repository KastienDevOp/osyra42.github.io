I'm excited to share that my latest update is currently in progress! In this phase of development, I'm exploring the potential of Disnake, a powerful Python library designed for integrating bots with the Discord platform.

As part of this exploration, I will be revisiting and potentially reverting some previous changes that did not align with my long-term development goals. This strategic adjustment will help me refine the bot's functionality and ensure a more robust and efficient user experience.

While I'm eager to share more details, I want to keep some aspects of this update under wraps to preserve the element of surprise. Stay tuned for further announcements as I continue to refine and enhance the bot!

Thank you for your continued support and patience as I work to bring you the best possible experience.

**Development Update Announcement**

I'm thrilled to announce the latest update for the bot, which introduces some significant changes and improvements! Here's what you can expect:

1. **Model Update**: I'm now utilizing the **Dolphin-2.5-mixtral-8x7b** model, which promises enhanced performance and more accurate responses. This model is designed to provide a better user experience with improved AI capabilities.

2. **Switch to Ollama**: In this update, I've transitioned from GPT4All to Ollama for much better performance. This change is expected to significantly enhance the bot's responsiveness and overall efficiency.

3. **Removed Cogs and Simplification Functions**: To streamline the bot's operation and improve response times, I've removed certain cogs and functions that were intended to simplify the development process and allow for expansion.

4. **Fixed Slash Commands and AI Response Disconnect Issues**: I've addressed and resolved issues related to slash commands and AI response disconnects, ensuring a smoother and more reliable user experience.

5. **Voice Module Removal**: After careful consideration, I've decided to remove the voice module output to Discord. The process was simply too slow and did not meet the desired performance standards.

This update aims to simplify the bot and get core functionalities back up and running smoothly, while also leveraging the new model and Ollama for better performance. Thank you for your continued support and patience as I work to improve the bot's performance and reliability.

**Development Update Announcement**

I'm excited to share a small but impactful update for the bot! Here's what's new:

1. **Model Update**: I'm now using the **nous-hermes-2-solar-10.7b.Q5_K_M** model. This model introduces various ways the bot can reply based on the roles the user might have, enhancing the interaction experience.

2. **Hardware Upgrade**: I've upgraded the PC Vanity is running on to include 64GB of RAM. This upgrade will significantly help with larger models, ensuring smoother and more efficient performance.

3. **Role-Based Responses**: The new model allows for more dynamic and context-aware responses, tailored to the roles users have within the Discord server.

4. **Speech Capabilities**: This update still utilizes OpenVoice for speech synthesis, ensuring that the bot can continue to provide spoken responses.

This update, though small, brings notable improvements to the bot's capabilities and performance. Thank you for your continued support and patience as I work to enhance the bot's functionality.
