I'm excited to share that my latest update is currently in progress! In this phase of development, I'm exploring the potential of Disnake, a powerful Python library designed for integrating bots with the Discord platform.

As part of this exploration, I will be revisiting and potentially reverting some previous changes that did not align with my long-term development goals. This strategic adjustment will help me refine the bot's functionality and ensure a more robust and efficient user experience.

While I'm eager to share more details, I want to keep some aspects of this update under wraps to preserve the element of surprise. Stay tuned for further announcements as I continue to refine and enhance the bot!

Thank you for your continued support and patience as I work to bring you the best possible experience.

I'm thrilled to announce the latest update for the bot, which introduces some significant changes and improvements! Here's what you can expect:

1. **Model Update**: I'm now utilizing the **Dolphin-2.5-mixtral-8x7b** model, which promises enhanced performance and more accurate responses. This model is designed to provide a better user experience with improved AI capabilities.

2. **Switch to Ollama**: In this update, I've transitioned from GPT4All to Ollama for much better performance. This change is expected to significantly enhance the bot's responsiveness and overall efficiency.

3. **Removed Cogs and Simplification Functions**: To streamline the bot's operation and improve response times, I've removed certain cogs and functions that were intended to simplify the development process and allow for expansion.

4. **Fixed Slash Commands and AI Response Disconnect Issues**: I've addressed and resolved issues related to slash commands and AI response disconnects, ensuring a smoother and more reliable user experience.

5. **Voice Module Removal**: After careful consideration, I've decided to remove the voice module output to Discord. The process was simply too slow and did not meet the desired performance standards.

This update aims to simplify the bot and get core functionalities back up and running smoothly, while also leveraging the new model and Ollama for better performance. Thank you for your continued support and patience as I work to improve the bot's performance and reliability.

I'm excited to share a small but impactful update for the bot! Here's what's new:

1. **Model Update**: I'm now using the **nous-hermes-2-solar-10.7b.Q5_K_M** model. This model introduces various ways the bot can reply based on the roles the user might have, enhancing the interaction experience.

2. **Hardware Upgrade**: I've upgraded the PC Vanity is running on to include 64GB of RAM. This upgrade will significantly help with larger models, ensuring smoother and more efficient performance.

3. **Role-Based Responses**: The new model allows for more dynamic and context-aware responses, tailored to the roles users have within the Discord server.

4. **Speech Capabilities**: This update still utilizes OpenVoice for speech synthesis, ensuring that the bot can continue to provide spoken responses.

This update, though small, brings notable improvements to the bot's capabilities and performance. Thank you for your continued support and patience as I work to enhance the bot's functionality.

I'm thrilled to announce the fifth iteration of Vanity Bot, and it's a massive update! This version represents a complete overhaul of the bot, with significant changes and exciting new features.

Key Features:

1. Switch to Python:
We've transitioned the entire codebase from JavaScript to Python. This change allows us to leverage Python's powerful libraries and frameworks, enabling more sophisticated and efficient development.

2. AI-Powered Responses:
We've integrated GPT4All with the Nous-Hermes-2-solar-10.7b model to power Vanity's responses. This AI model provides more intelligent, contextually relevant, and dynamic interactions, making conversations with Vanity feel more natural and engaging.

3. Voice Responses:
In addition to text responses, Vanity now uses OpenVoice to generate voice responses. This means that all of Vanity's replies are voiced, adding a new layer of interactivity and immersion.

4. Multiple Personalities:
We've introduced the ability for Vanity to switch between different "personalities" based on user roles. This feature allows for more tailored and varied interactions, making Vanity feel more versatile and adaptable.

5. Removed Minecraft Playing:
Unfortunately, we had to remove the Minecraft playing feature to focus on the core improvements and new functionalities. However, we're exploring ways to reintroduce similar features in the future.

This update marks a significant leap forward in making Vanity a more intelligent, interactive, and versatile bot. We're excited to see how these new features will enhance your experience with the bot.

Stay tuned for more updates and improvements. Your feedback is crucial, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts and suggestions!

I'm thrilled to announce the second iteration of Vanity Bot! In this update, we've introduced some exciting new features that make the bot more interactive and responsive.

Key Features:

1. Regex-Based Message Recognition:
Vanity can now recognize specific patterns in messages using regular expressions (regex). When a matching pattern is detected, the bot responds with a randomized reply, making interactions more dynamic and engaging.

2. Interactive Commands:
We've added a few new commands that enhance user interaction:
    
    Announcement Repeater: The bot can now repeat announcements or important messages, ensuring they get the attention they deserve.

    Direct Messaging: Vanity can send direct messages (DMs) to users, providing a more personalized experience.

This update marks the first significant step towards making Vanity more responsive and user-centric. We're just getting started, and there's plenty more to come!

Stay tuned for more updates and improvements. As always, your feedback is invaluable, so don't hesitate to share your thoughts!
