This is a new concept of the books.
I greatly appreciate any feedback.


Osyra's Background
-----------------------------------
Background and Motivation:
Osyra, born into a wealthy family with strong ties to the biotech industry, pursued a major in biology. Her parents’ influence and resources allowed her to conduct groundbreaking research. After college, Osyra focused on creating a virus that could alter human DNA to grant animal traits. Her goal was to push the limits of human evolution, but her methods were ethically questionable.

The Procedure:
Osyra’s procedure involved a virus designed to rewrite human DNA, enabling the expression of animal characteristics such as enhanced senses, strength, or agility. The process was still experimental, and Osyra used primarily homeless individuals as test subjects, believing they wouldn’t be missed.

The Raid and Injection:
One of the test subjects, after escaping from Osyra’s facility, died in a hospital and tipped off authorities about the unethical experiments. This led to a raid by the SCP Foundation. During the raid, Layla, another test subject who had undergone the procedure, managed to inject Osyra with her own serum in the chaos, forever altering Osyra’s life. Layla, filled with rage for the life Osyra had taken from her, became her sworn enemy.

Capture and Choice:
The SCP Foundation recognized Osyra’s unique amnestic properties—her ability to make herself forgettable through her sweat or pheromones—and decided she could be a valuable asset. Rather than imprisoning her as a Class D subject, they offered her a choice: work for them as an observer, using her abilities to provide critical insights into dangerous entities, or face punishment for her unethical crimes, likely resulting in becoming a Class D. Faced with these options, Osyra reluctantly agreed to work for the SCP Foundation, all while harboring a deep resentment toward Layla for their mutual downfall




Layla's Background
-----------------------------------
Background and Motivation:
Layla was adopted at a young age by parents who were both accomplished in the field of technology—her father was an electrical engineer, and her mother was a programmer. They worked together on advanced robotics, driven by the dream of creating a humanoid AI assistant. Layla grew up immersed in this environment, absorbing their knowledge and passion for technology. When she was 19, both of her parents died unexpectedly, leaving her alone and grief-stricken. As their only child, she inherited their work, including a partially completed project involving a robotic humanoid body. Determined to honor her parents' legacy, Layla dedicated herself to finishing what they started.

The AI Project:
After her parents' death, Layla became a freelance web developer to support herself, allowing her to spend the rest of her time working on the AI project. She painstakingly studied her parents' notes, learning how to bring their vision to life. The project, a humanoid AI assistant, was complex and challenging, and Layla often found herself overwhelmed by the enormity of the task.

The Incident:
As the pressure mounted, Layla occasionally sought solace at a local bar. One fateful night, during one of these visits, someone slipped something into her drink. Disoriented and sensing danger, Layla left the bar but collapsed on the sidewalk shortly after. It was there that Osyra found her, setting off a chain of events that would irrevocably change both of their lives.

Transformation and Conflict:
Layla was taken to Osyra’s facility, where she became one of the many test subjects in Osyra’s experimental procedures. After being injected with the virus, Layla developed animal traits, including enhanced senses, strength, and agility. However, these abilities came with severe mental instability, fueling her anger and resentment toward Osyra. The once-promising young woman was now a victim of a cruel experiment, and her life’s purpose shifted from completing her parents’ work to seeking revenge on Osyra for the horrors she had endured.
