    <h3>
      Iâ€™m working on the main rewrite of the book! This is a great opportunity to drop any bad concepts and improve the
      spellings of names and locations. Expect a fresh and refined version of the story that retains its core essence
      while embracing these improvements.

        ### Concept

Osyra was born into wealth and pursued a major in biology. After college, she created a procedure to grant humans animal traits. During her experiments, the SCP Foundation raided her facility. In the chaos, Osyra was injected with her own serum. She and the other victims began exhibiting anomalous traits. Osyra's new abilities included an instinctive knowledge of how to kill anomalous creatures. The SCP Foundation then assigned her to eliminate dangerous entities, remaining on call for any necessary exterminations.
