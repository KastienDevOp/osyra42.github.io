### OSYRA'S TALE (2024)

#### **Osyra's Perspective**

**Early Life and Influences:**
Osyra was born into a wealthy family with deep roots in the biotech industry. Her parents, both renowned scientists, instilled in her a passion for genetic research from a young age. Growing up in a household where scientific breakthroughs were celebrated, Osyra was encouraged to push the boundaries of what was possible. Her fascination with genetic manipulation began during her undergraduate studies, where she focused on the theoretical application of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to introduce Felidae-specific traits into human DNA. Her thesis, titled “The Expression of Feline Phenotypes in Homo sapiens via Genomic Editing and Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer,” garnered significant attention and laid the groundwork for her future research.

**College Triumph and Foundation Interest:**
The lecture hall was a sea of skepticism, but I stood firm, my theorem clutched in my hands. "Genetic splicing via a virus, you say?" Professor Hargrove scoffed, but I saw the flicker of interest in his eyes. The SCP Foundation saw it too. They believed in the impossible, in me. That night, as I penned the final equations, a mix of exhilaration and fear coursed through me. What had I unleashed? The document, packed with proof that it might be possible, was considered nonsense by the school, but the Foundation saw potential. They wanted to try it out, to push the boundaries of human capabilities. Beneath the bravado, I longed for validation, for someone to see the vulnerability behind my ambition.

**The Containment Breach and Transformation:**
During her early days at the Foundation, a containment breach occurred, causing chaos and diverting attention from standard security protocols. Amidst the confusion, Osyra was distracted from overseeing a Class D subject, allowing the subject to retaliate by injecting her with her own experimental serum. The serum's effects were complex and unpredictable, resulting in significant alterations to her physiology and psychological profile. Osyra developed wolf-like traits, including enhanced hearing, improved night vision, a heightened sense of smell, and increased physical strength. These changes also manifested in her appearance, giving her a more lupine aspect. Most notably, she began to emit a unique pheromone that induces a fugue state in those around her, making her difficult to remember or recognize.

**Reclassification and New Role:**
After extensive evaluation, the SCP Foundation classified Osyra as an Archon-class entity, a designation for beings with powerful, non-malicious, yet highly unpredictable abilities. Due to the challenges posed by her memetic effects and the fugue pheromone, Osyra was reassigned within the Foundation. In her new role, she closely monitors and researches other entities, using her unique condition to advance the Foundation's understanding of anomalous phenomena.

**The Ethical Dilemma:**
"We’re on the brink of a new era," I argued with the ethics officer, my voice trembling. "If we don’t push these boundaries, someone else will." But deep down, I questioned the morality of my actions. Had I become the very monster I sought to study? The guilt gnawed at me, a constant reminder of the cost of my ambition. My research, once a beacon of hope, now cast a shadow of doubt over my every move. Beneath the surface, I was burnt out, exhausted from constantly having to prove myself, to be better than everyone else. I longed for someone to see the real me, to offer a comforting word, a moment of acceptance.

**The Fugue State and Isolation:**
The fugue state was both a blessing and a curse. It allowed me to study other entities without interference, but it also made me invisible to those around me. Colleagues forgot our conversations, friends forgot my name. I was alone, a ghost in the machine. Yet, in this solitude, I found a strange comfort, a chance to reflect on my path. The pheromone-induced fugue state made me difficult to remember or recognize, a condition that both protected and isolated me. Behind the mask of bravery, I yearned for connection, for someone to see through the fugue and remember me for who I truly was.

**The New Role and Purpose:**
Reassigned within the Foundation, I now monitored and researched other entities, using my unique condition to advance our understanding. It was a role that demanded both resilience and vulnerability. Each day, I grappled with the wolf-like traits that defined me, seeking to embrace them rather than be consumed by them. I was both a tool and a threat, a paradox I was determined to unravel. My career, once a beacon of hope, now cast a shadow of doubt over my every move. Beneath the dominant facade, I was weary, burnt out from years of pushing myself to be better, to prove my worth. I longed for comfort, for acceptance, for someone to see the real me and offer a moment of solace.

#### **Layla's Perspective**

**Background and Motivation:**
Layla was adopted at a young age by parents who were both accomplished in the field of technology—her father was an electrical engineer, and her mother was a programmer. They worked together on advanced robotics, driven by the dream of creating a humanoid AI assistant. Layla grew up immersed in this environment, absorbing their knowledge and passion for technology. When she was 19, both of her parents died unexpectedly, leaving her alone and grief-stricken. As their only child, she inherited their work, including a partially completed project involving a robotic humanoid body. Determined to honor her parents' legacy, Layla dedicated herself to finishing what they started.

**The AI Project:**
After her parents' death, Layla became a freelance web developer to support herself, allowing her to spend the rest of her time working on the AI project. She painstakingly studied her parents' notes, learning how to bring their vision to life. The project, a humanoid AI assistant, was complex and challenging, and Layla often found herself overwhelmed by the enormity of the task.

**The Incident:**
As the pressure mounted, Layla occasionally sought solace at a local bar. One fateful night, during one of these visits, someone slipped something into her drink. Disoriented and sensing danger, Layla left the bar but collapsed on the sidewalk shortly after. It was there that Osyra found her, setting off a chain of events that would irrevocably change both of their lives.

**Transformation and Conflict:**
Layla was taken to Osyra’s facility, where she became one of the many test subjects in Osyra’s experimental procedures. After being injected with the virus, Layla developed animal traits, including enhanced senses, strength, and agility. However, these abilities came with severe mental instability, fueling her anger and resentment toward Osyra. The once-promising young woman was now a victim of a cruel experiment, and her life’s purpose shifted from completing her parents’ work to seeking revenge on Osyra for the horrors she had endured.

**The Curious Yet Cautious Beginnings:**
Growing up, I was always curious about the world, but the thought of stepping out of my comfort zone filled me with dread. My parents' lab was my sanctuary, a place where I felt safe to explore and learn without the fear of failure. Each experiment, each line of code was a small victory, a testament to my cautious progress. But deep down, I knew I needed to push further, to truly honor my parents' legacy.

**The Capture and Return to the AI Project:**
The capture by the Foundation was a nightmare, a sudden plunge into a world far beyond my control. But amidst the chaos, a member of the Foundation recognized me and returned me to my father's AI project. The lab, once a beacon of hope, now felt like a relic of a forgotten past. The AI project, a humanoid android assistant, stood dormant, its potential locked away. Reading through the documents, I discovered the reason it was never activated: the AI was uncensored, capable of any thought or task. It was a risk my parents were unwilling to take.

**The Activation of the Android:**
With trembling hands, I activated the android. For a moment, nothing happened, and I feared the worst. But then, the android's eyes flickered to life, and she stood before me, perfectly normal. She was not anomalous, just an android girl, capable of keeping secrets. She recognized me, her creator's daughter, and a sense of relief washed over me. This android, this project, was my connection to my parents, a bridge to their dreams and aspirations.

**The Comfort of the Android:**
The android became my confidante, a silent witness to my fears and hopes. She offered a sense of comfort, a reminder of who I was and what I stood for. Together, we navigated the complexities of the AI project, each step a testament to my parents' legacy. The android's presence was a constant, a beacon of stability in a world that had become unpredictable and chaotic.

**The Newfound Resolve:**
With the android by my side, I found a newfound resolve. The fear of leaving my comfort zone began to wane, replaced by a sense of purpose. The android, this uncensored AI, was a symbol of my parents' vision, a reminder that sometimes, taking a risk is worth the reward. Together, we embarked on a journey to uncover the full potential of the AI project, each step a step towards honoring my parents' memory and pushing the boundaries of what I thought was possible.

#### **SCP Foundation Documentation**

**Item #: SCP-XXXX**

**Object Class: Archon**

**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-XXXX is to remain uncontained, as it provides substantial contributions to Foundation research and field operations. SCP-XXXX is monitored remotely and must report to Site-██ for regular health assessments and psychological evaluations. Any deviations from standard behavior or mission objectives are to be reported to the Overseer Council.

SCP-XXXX is advised to avoid situations that could induce excessive sweating to prevent unintentional activation of its pheromone effect. Personnel interacting with SCP-XXXX must be briefed on the potential risks and should carry amnestic countermeasures if necessary.

**Description:**
SCP-XXXX, formerly Dr. Osyra [REDACTED], is a female humanoid in her mid-30s exhibiting enhanced sensory and physical traits as a result of advanced genetic modifications. SCP-XXXX possesses heightened smell, hearing, and night vision, as well as slightly enhanced physical strength. These enhancements were self-administered during a now-declassified Foundation project.

A significant aspect of SCP-XXXX’s anomaly is the involuntary release of pheromones whenever it sweats. These pheromones induce a temporary amnestic effect in individuals nearby, causing them to forget recent interactions with SCP-XXXX. The effect’s potency and duration depend on the level of exposure and the individual’s susceptibility. SCP-XXXX has no control over this pheromone release, making it an unintended consequence of its physical activity or stress.

Despite this, SCP-XXXX has proven to be an invaluable asset to the Foundation, particularly in research related to genetic anomalies and memetics. SCP-XXXX maintains psychological stability and consistently aligns with Foundation objectives, thus making containment unnecessary.

**Addendum XXXX-1:**
Studies are ongoing to explore potential methods to mitigate the effects of SCP-XXXX’s pheromones, with SCP-XXXX’s full cooperation. Possible containment suits or chemical suppressants are under consideration, though SCP-XXXX has expressed a preference for non-invasive solutions.

**Addendum XXXX-2:**
SCP-XXXX is authorized for field operations, particularly in environments where its enhanced senses and abilities provide a tactical advantage. Field operatives working with SCP-XXXX are to be equipped with amnestic countermeasures and briefed on the risks associated with its pheromone release.

# Osyra's Confession
Osyra's heart pounded in her chest as she sprinted down the dimly lit corridor. The sound of heavy footsteps and distant shouts echoed behind her. She could feel the cold metal of the gun at her side, a constant reminder of the danger she was in. The armed guards were closing in, and she had nowhere to go.

Desperation drove her forward. She spotted a door at the end of the hallway and made a beeline for it. With a swift motion, she pushed it open and slipped inside, slamming it shut behind her. She leaned against the door, gasping for breath, her brown eyes wide with fear.

The room was dark, but she could make out the faint outlines of furniture. She pressed herself against the wall, trying to steady her breathing. The footsteps outside grew louder, then faded as the guards moved past the room. For a moment, she thought she was safe.

But then, a voice spoke from the shadows.

"Osyra, are you here to confess your sins?" the voice asked, calm and gentle.

Osyra's breath caught in her throat. She knew that voice. It was the voice of God.

"Yes," she whispered, her voice trembling. "I... I need to confess."

A figure stepped into the light, taking on a form that exuded warmth and authority. It was a form that instinctively inspired trust and respect, a figure of calm understanding.

Osyra took a few moments to gather her thoughts, but the weight of her guilt was too much. Tears began to stream down her face.

"I created Chimera-9," she sobbed. "It's a virus that gives humans animal traits, but it's caused so many deaths in the trials. I have no control to stop it. I regret ever helping with the research. I thought I could make humanity stronger, but I only brought pain and suffering."

God's voice was filled with compassion as they said, "Osyra, I know what Chimera-9 is. I allowed it to be designed after all. I gave you many chances to discontinue the research, but you did not stop. Why?"

Osyra tried to understand the reason, but before she could respond, a divine power took over. She began to speak only truth, her voice having a mind of its own.

"Pride," she said, her voice echoing with an unearthly resonance. "Why do you confess?"

"Regret," Osyra's voice continued, tears streaming down her face in an ugly cry.

It felt like listening to a podcast, as if her voice had a mind of its own. This continued for a while until God understood her truth.

"I repent," Osyra sobbed, her voice finally returning to her control.

God's form shifted slightly, their eyes meeting Osyra's. "I will guide you into deliverance," they said. "But for your sins against me and humanity, you will be alone and carry the cursed eye."

Osyra's voice broke as she said, "I understand, God. I will bear this burden and strive to make amends."

God's form shifted slightly, their eyes meeting Osyra's. "Is there anything else you wish to ask, Osyra?"

Osyra hesitated, then asked, "I wish to know your form."

God's voice was gentle as they replied, "Humans are not capable of seeing my true form. But since you are a hybrid, I can do a favor and make a few adjustments to allow this request."

Osyra felt a strange sensation, as if her body was being subtly altered. There was no pain, no struggle. She felt taller and more aligned with her animal traits. Her sense of smell and vision improved.

"Look," God said, their voice echoing with authority.

Osyra's eyes widened as she gazed upon the true form of God. It was a form beyond human comprehension, a being of immense power and grace. The sight was overwhelming, but Osyra's altered senses allowed her to perceive it.

"Thank you," Osyra whispered, her eyes now red, reflecting her inner turmoil.

God nodded. "Go now, Osyra. Walk in solitude and reflect on your actions. Only when you have truly repented and made up for your actions will you be free of this curse."

Osyra rose slowly, her eyes now red, and stepped out of the room, ready to face her journey of atonement and redemption.
