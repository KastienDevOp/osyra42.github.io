This is a new concept of the books. I greatly appreciate any feedback.



Osyra's Background
-----------------------------------
Osyra, born into a wealthy family with strong ties to the biotech industry, pursued a major in biology. Her parents’ influence and resources allowed her to conduct groundbreaking research. After graduating from college with a degree in biology, Osyra was scouted by the SCP Foundation for her innovative research in genetic modification. Her work involved a procedure using a virus capable of altering human DNA to grant animal traits, a breakthrough with potentially profound implications.

During her early days at the Foundation, a containment breach occurred, causing chaos and diverting attention from standard security protocols. Amidst the confusion, Osyra was distracted from overseeing a Class D subject. This lapse allowed the subject to retaliate, injecting Osyra with her own experimental serum.

Following the incident, Osyra was immediately contained and subjected to rigorous testing. The serum's effects were complex and unpredictable, resulting in significant alterations to her physiology and psychological profile. Osyra developed wolf-like traits, including enhanced hearing, improved night vision, a heightened sense of smell, and increased physical strength. These changes also manifested in her appearance, giving her a more lupine aspect. Most notably, she began to emit a unique pheromone that induces a fugue state in those around her, making her difficult to remember or recognize.

After extensive evaluation, the SCP Foundation classified Osyra as an Archon-class entity, a designation for beings with powerful, non-malicious, yet highly unpredictable abilities. Due to the challenges posed by her memetic effects and the fugue pheromone, Osyra was reassigned within the Foundation. In her new role, she closely monitors and researches other entities, using her unique condition to advance the Foundation's understanding of anomalous phenomena.



Layla's Background
-----------------------------------
Background and Motivation:
Layla was adopted at a young age by parents who were both accomplished in the field of technology—her father was an electrical engineer, and her mother was a programmer. They worked together on advanced robotics, driven by the dream of creating a humanoid AI assistant. Layla grew up immersed in this environment, absorbing their knowledge and passion for technology. When she was 19, both of her parents died unexpectedly, leaving her alone and grief-stricken. As their only child, she inherited their work, including a partially completed project involving a robotic humanoid body. Determined to honor her parents' legacy, Layla dedicated herself to finishing what they started.

The AI Project:
After her parents' death, Layla became a freelance web developer to support herself, allowing her to spend the rest of her time working on the AI project. She painstakingly studied her parents' notes, learning how to bring their vision to life. The project, a humanoid AI assistant, was complex and challenging, and Layla often found herself overwhelmed by the enormity of the task.

The Incident:
As the pressure mounted, Layla occasionally sought solace at a local bar. One fateful night, during one of these visits, someone slipped something into her drink. Disoriented and sensing danger, Layla left the bar but collapsed on the sidewalk shortly after. It was there that Osyra found her, setting off a chain of events that would irrevocably change both of their lives.

Transformation and Conflict:
Layla was taken to Osyra’s facility, where she became one of the many test subjects in Osyra’s experimental procedures. After being injected with the virus, Layla developed animal traits, including enhanced senses, strength, and agility. However, these abilities came with severe mental instability, fueling her anger and resentment toward Osyra. The once-promising young woman was now a victim of a cruel experiment, and her life’s purpose shifted from completing her parents’ work to seeking revenge on Osyra for the horrors she had endured.
