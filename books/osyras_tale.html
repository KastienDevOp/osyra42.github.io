OSYRA'S TALE (2024)

Osyra's Background
-----------------------------------
Osyra, born into a wealthy family with strong ties to the biotech industry, pursued a major in biology. Her parents’ influence and resources allowed her to conduct groundbreaking research. After graduating from college with a degree in biology, Osyra was scouted by the SCP Foundation for her innovative research in genetic modification. Her work involved a procedure using a virus capable of altering human DNA to grant animal traits, a breakthrough with potentially profound implications.

During her early days at the Foundation, a containment breach occurred, causing chaos and diverting attention from standard security protocols. Amidst the confusion, Osyra was distracted from overseeing a Class D subject. This lapse allowed the subject to retaliate, injecting Osyra with her own experimental serum.

Following the incident, Osyra was immediately contained and subjected to rigorous testing. The serum's effects were complex and unpredictable, resulting in significant alterations to her physiology and psychological profile. Osyra developed wolf-like traits, including enhanced hearing, improved night vision, a heightened sense of smell, and increased physical strength. These changes also manifested in her appearance, giving her a more lupine aspect. Most notably, she began to emit a unique pheromone that induces a fugue state in those around her, making her difficult to remember or recognize.

After extensive evaluation, the SCP Foundation classified Osyra as an Archon-class entity, a designation for beings with powerful, non-malicious, yet highly unpredictable abilities. Due to the challenges posed by her memetic effects and the fugue pheromone, Osyra was reassigned within the Foundation. In her new role, she closely monitors and researches other entities, using her unique condition to advance the Foundation's understanding of anomalous phenomena.


Layla's Background
-----------------------------------
Background and Motivation:
Layla was adopted at a young age by parents who were both accomplished in the field of technology—her father was an electrical engineer, and her mother was a programmer. They worked together on advanced robotics, driven by the dream of creating a humanoid AI assistant. Layla grew up immersed in this environment, absorbing their knowledge and passion for technology. When she was 19, both of her parents died unexpectedly, leaving her alone and grief-stricken. As their only child, she inherited their work, including a partially completed project involving a robotic humanoid body. Determined to honor her parents' legacy, Layla dedicated herself to finishing what they started.

The AI Project:
After her parents' death, Layla became a freelance web developer to support herself, allowing her to spend the rest of her time working on the AI project. She painstakingly studied her parents' notes, learning how to bring their vision to life. The project, a humanoid AI assistant, was complex and challenging, and Layla often found herself overwhelmed by the enormity of the task.

The Incident:
As the pressure mounted, Layla occasionally sought solace at a local bar. One fateful night, during one of these visits, someone slipped something into her drink. Disoriented and sensing danger, Layla left the bar but collapsed on the sidewalk shortly after. It was there that Osyra found her, setting off a chain of events that would irrevocably change both of their lives.

Transformation and Conflict:
Layla was taken to Osyra’s facility, where she became one of the many test subjects in Osyra’s experimental procedures. After being injected with the virus, Layla developed animal traits, including enhanced senses, strength, and agility. However, these abilities came with severe mental instability, fueling her anger and resentment toward Osyra. The once-promising young woman was now a victim of a cruel experiment, and her life’s purpose shifted from completing her parents’ work to seeking revenge on Osyra for the horrors she had endured.


    - What are Osyra’s inner motivations and personality? Why was she driven to conduct such risky experiments in the first place? Is it purely for scientific progress, or does she have a deeper, personal motivation?
    - How does Layla struggle with the loss of her parents, and how does this grief influence her decisions during and after her transformation?
    - Does Layla's connection to the AI project play a bigger role in her character arc?
    - How are themes like bioethics, the morality of scientific progress, and the nature of humanity explored in the story?
    - How do both Osyra and Layla cope with the loss of control over their bodies?
    - How does Osyra fit within the larger context of the SCP Foundation? What is her relationship with the Foundation? Is she under constant surveillance?
    - How does Layla’s freelance web developer job and her inherited AI project influence her choices? Does her AI project play a role in her battle with Osyra?
    - Does Osyra feel remorse for Layla's transformation, or does she rationalize it as necessary for science?
    - Does Layla’s descent into revenge reflect a growing similarity to Osyra, the person she despises?
    - How does Osyra’s transformation affect her career, reputation, or relationships within the Foundation?
    - How does Layla adapt to her new abilities before realizing the full extent of her instability? Does she find ways to use them before descending into anger?
    - How does Osyra’s pheromone-induced fugue state affect her emotionally? Does she feel isolated because people forget her? What risks or limitations come with this power?
    - How does Layla’s transformation affect her perception of the world around her?
    - How does Osyra physically and emotionally cope with her wolf-like traits?
    - How can the emotional stakes for both characters be deepened?
    - How can the pacing of Layla’s revenge arc be slowed down to create greater tension and tragedy?



Item #: SCP-XXXX

Object Class: Archon

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-XXXX is to remain uncontained, as it provides substantial contributions to Foundation research and field operations. SCP-XXXX is monitored remotely and must report to Site-██ for regular health assessments and psychological evaluations. Any deviations from standard behavior or mission objectives are to be reported to the Overseer Council.

SCP-XXXX is advised to avoid situations that could induce excessive sweating to prevent unintentional activation of its pheromone effect. Personnel interacting with SCP-XXXX must be briefed on the potential risks and should carry amnestic countermeasures if necessary.

Description: SCP-XXXX, formerly Dr. Osyra [REDACTED], is a female humanoid in her mid-30s exhibiting enhanced sensory and physical traits as a result of advanced genetic modifications. SCP-XXXX possesses heightened smell, hearing, and night vision, as well as slightly enhanced physical strength. These enhancements were self-administered during a now-declassified Foundation project.

A significant aspect of SCP-XXXX’s anomaly is the involuntary release of pheromones whenever it sweats. These pheromones induce a temporary amnestic effect in individuals nearby, causing them to forget recent interactions with SCP-XXXX. The effect’s potency and duration depend on the level of exposure and the individual’s susceptibility. SCP-XXXX has no control over this pheromone release, making it an unintended consequence of its physical activity or stress.
Despite this, SCP-XXXX has proven to be an invaluable asset to the Foundation, particularly in research related to genetic anomalies and memetics. SCP-XXXX maintains psychological stability and consistently aligns with Foundation objectives, thus making containment unnecessary.

Addendum XXXX-1: Studies are ongoing to explore potential methods to mitigate the effects of SCP-XXXX’s pheromones, with SCP-XXXX’s full cooperation. Possible containment suits or chemical suppressants are under consideration, though SCP-XXXX has expressed a preference for non-invasive solutions.

Addendum XXXX-2: SCP-XXXX is authorized for field operations, particularly in environments where its enhanced senses and abilities provide a tactical advantage. Field operatives working with SCP-XXXX are to be equipped with amnestic countermeasures and briefed on the risks associated with its pheromone release.










Osyra’s Perspective
1.	The College Triumph and Foundation Interest:
The lecture hall was a sea of skepticism, but I stood firm, my theorem clutched in my hands. "Genetic splicing via a virus, you say?" Professor Hargrove scoffed, but I saw the flicker of interest in his eyes. The SCP Foundation saw it too. They believed in the impossible, in me. That night, as I penned the final equations, a mix of exhilaration and fear coursed through me. What had I unleashed? The document, packed with proof that it might be possible, was considered nonsense by the school, but the Foundation saw potential. They wanted to try it out, to push the boundaries of human capabilities. Beneath the bravado, I longed for validation, for someone to see the vulnerability behind my ambition.
2.	The Containment Breach and Transformation:
The containment breach was chaos incarnate. Amidst the confusion, I lost focus, and it cost me dearly. The serum, my creation, coursed through my veins, altering me in ways I couldn't fathom. Wolf-like traits, enhanced senses, a fugue-inducing pheromone—these were not just tools; they were a part of me now. The Foundation classified me as an Archon-class entity, a designation that both honored and isolated me. I was immediately contained and subjected to rigorous testing, my new abilities both a marvel and a curse. Behind the dominant persona, I craved comfort, a moment to rest and be accepted for who I was, not what I had become.
3.	The Ethical Dilemma:
"We’re on the brink of a new era," I argued with the ethics officer, my voice trembling. "If we don’t push these boundaries, someone else will." But deep down, I questioned the morality of my actions. Had I become the very monster I sought to study? The guilt gnawed at me, a constant reminder of the cost of my ambition. My research, once a beacon of hope, now cast a shadow of doubt over my every move. Beneath the surface, I was burnt out, exhausted from constantly having to prove myself, to be better than everyone else. I longed for someone to see the real me, to offer a comforting word, a moment of acceptance.
4.	The Fugue State and Isolation:
The fugue state was both a blessing and a curse. It allowed me to study other entities without interference, but it also made me invisible to those around me. Colleagues forgot our conversations, friends forgot my name. I was alone, a ghost in the machine. Yet, in this solitude, I found a strange comfort, a chance to reflect on my path. The pheromone-induced fugue state made me difficult to remember or recognize, a condition that both protected and isolated me. Behind the mask of bravery, I yearned for connection, for someone to see through the fugue and remember me for who I truly was.
5.	The New Role and Purpose:
Reassigned within the Foundation, I now monitored and researched other entities, using my unique condition to advance our understanding. It was a role that demanded both resilience and vulnerability. Each day, I grappled with the wolf-like traits that defined me, seeking to embrace them rather than be consumed by them. I was both a tool and a threat, a paradox I was determined to unravel. My career, once a beacon of hope, now cast a shadow of doubt over my every move. Beneath the dominant facade, I was weary, burnt out from years of pushing myself to be better, to prove my worth. I longed for comfort, for acceptance, for someone to see the real me and offer a moment of solace.




Layla’s Perspective
1.	The Curious Yet Cautious Beginnings:
Growing up, I was always curious about the world, but the thought of stepping out of my comfort zone filled me with dread. My parents' lab was my sanctuary, a place where I felt safe to explore and learn without the fear of failure. Each experiment, each line of code was a small victory, a testament to my cautious progress. But deep down, I knew I needed to push further, to truly honor my parents' legacy.
2.	The Capture and Return to the AI Project:
The capture by the Foundation was a nightmare, a sudden plunge into a world far beyond my control. But amidst the chaos, a member of the Foundation recognized me and returned me to my father's AI project. The lab, once a beacon of hope, now felt like a relic of a forgotten past. The AI project, a humanoid android assistant, stood dormant, its potential locked away. Reading through the documents, I discovered the reason it was never activated: the AI was uncensored, capable of any thought or task. It was a risk my parents were unwilling to take.
3.	The Activation of the Android:
With trembling hands, I activated the android. For a moment, nothing happened, and I feared the worst. But then, the android's eyes flickered to life, and she stood before me, perfectly normal. She was not anomalous, just an android girl, capable of keeping secrets. She recognized me, her creator's daughter, and a sense of relief washed over me. This android, this project, was my connection to my parents, a bridge to their dreams and aspirations.
4.	The Comfort of the Android:
The android became my confidante, a silent witness to my fears and hopes. She offered a sense of comfort, a reminder of who I was and what I stood for. Together, we navigated the complexities of the AI project, each step a testament to my parents' legacy. The android's presence was a constant, a beacon of stability in a world that had become unpredictable and chaotic.
5.	The Newfound Resolve:
With the android by my side, I found a newfound resolve. The fear of leaving my comfort zone began to wane, replaced by a sense of purpose. The android, this uncensored AI, was a symbol of my parents' vision, a reminder that sometimes, taking a risk is worth the reward. Together, we embarked on a journey to uncover the full potential of the AI project, each step a step towards honoring my parents' memory and pushing the boundaries of what I thought was possible.


Background: Osyra, born into an influential family with a long history in both academia and biotechnology, exhibited an early fascination with genetic manipulation. By the age of 21, Osyra had begun her thesis for her undergraduate studies in biology, which focused on the theoretical application of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to introduce Felidae-specific traits into human DNA. Titled “The Expression of Feline Phenotypes in Homo sapiens via Genomic Editing and Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer,” the document proposed that selective activation of certain feline genes could be facilitated through the modification of regulatory gene sequences, particularly within the HOX and PAX gene families.
Her research suggested that alterations in these developmental genes would lead to the manifestation of physical feline attributes, such as digitigrade locomotion, enhanced nocturnal vision, and the growth of vestigial tails. Osyra's early experimentation on animal models yielded promising results, demonstrating the viability of cross-species gene expression while maintaining the structural integrity of human-like physiology. Though never intended for human application during her academic tenure, her findings implied the potential for an entirely new branch of genomic science: the synthesis of hybridized humanoid phenotypes.
