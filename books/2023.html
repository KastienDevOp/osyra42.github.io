    Welcome to "the book what I wrote". This is the 6th revision, I will do my best to keep this updating frequently. New stuff will be highlighted. At the bottom of the screen you may jump to a chapter or just start reading.
    Occasionally there will be a bookmark that you can click. This will change the website's link. You can either save that link to remember that place or use a cookie and your browser will remember it for you.

    "YO HO HO", a lieutenant at the front of the plane shouts, we all started to call him Santa when we noticed he always did supply drops, it seems he just went along with it. Today we were going to be the supply and we knew it, "Our drop zone is hot as hell so you better hit the ground running.", he continues to speak while moving to the back. "You got about 30 seconds to be ready.", he finishes and presses a button that opens the back. The rush of air drowns out the clattering of weapons and various gear.

    I reach down and pick up my bag, it has a huge weapon case stuffed into it and locked into place with a few straps. For this mission I have been assigned as a sniper.

    My name is sergeant Layla Null and for this mission I will be taking a team of six into a lab to secure research on some secret project.

I am pulled from my thoughts when the lieutenant stop in front of me. "Are you ready to lead your team to victory?" he shouts so I am hear him.

    "Yes sir" put my bag on my feont side and stand immediately and walk over to the open door. I grab a parashute from off the secure wall and put it on my back. I look back and motion for my team to do the same. "Follow me!" I shout and then lean over the edge to fall out of the plane.
