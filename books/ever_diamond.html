Tom was up at 6:00am on the Monday morning that his life would start to change. He got up and turned off the alarm, then turned on the light. Changed his clothes and got his wallet and pocket knife to put in his pocket. When he went for his change he stopped to examine the money more closely. The the 5 or 6 pennies and dimes were meaningless to him so he shoved them into his pocket. also the old quarter he put in his pocket. What remained seemed to have deeper meaning then what everyone else was. Everyone else was money, he was memories. A Delaware quarter head a picture of Paul Revere but it was a the horse he wanted. "Much rather have a Virginia." he said to himself. The Virginia quarter as he remembered it has the picture more of the horse than anything else. Another quarter of Crater Lake, he just liked it. The last quarter was a bicentennial. Last week he's traded a paper dollar for a dollar coin. the year was 2000. A half dollar had been given to him for helping and old man at an auction. He shoved the coins in his pocket.

The clock read 6:23am and he had to leave for the bus at about 6:40am. He was 16 but didn't have a license to drive or even a permit. The bus ride wasn't that bad, it gave him time to think. There were some people that would talk to him, but he still felt alone.

He went to the kitchen and opened the fridge to find something to eat, but he (without knowing it) had already made up his mind to ger a plum so he would't create suspicion for his step-dad.

His brother and sister were already in where but they didn't eat anything. They sat still in front of the TV. The satellite guide covered the screen for 5 minutes without warning before they noticed what had happened. His step-dad turning it on so they couldn't see the show. (Maybe they'll get their show on and get ready to go.)

He got hos jacket on and started toi get his backpack on when his little brother Dean asked where hi was going. "I'm going to the bus." He walked over to the door and opened it and went out. Once out of the door he walked over to the opposite side of the porch and grabbed his Machete and started down the dirt hill.

When his little brother and sister came down the hill he was chopping the limbs from the 2007 ice storm. It was well into April now so they weren't in the way but they needed cleaned up. When the bus came he stabbed the Machete into the ground and ran up the stairs. His seat was 2 seats from the back on the right. He sat down took his backpack off and took out a book and started to read. 20 to 30 minutes later a friend of his came on. Her name was Pony and her 16th birthday was last week, and he had given her a shirt with horses on it because he knew she loved horses. If was quire some time before either said a word. He could see the answer on her face before he asked, "Did you weekend go well?"

"Yeah it was great." in a cheery voice. That weekend her friends came over to her house to spend the night.

"Do you think you can do me a favor?"

"Depends, what is it?"

"Could you give this to Brittany?" Tom holds out a note with Brittany's name drawn on it.

She took is looking a little disappointed. "Sure, I have biology with her first block."

He sits back in his seat for a moment and starts twitting with a ting that appears heavier than an ordinary ting, he seemed to be deep in thought. I looked over a her and she was playing with her Magical Wrench. He taps her on the shoulder, and she jumps. "I would like you to have this, it will protect you." He holds out his hand in a fist so she can't see the ring inside. Trusting him she she holds her hand under his, he drops the ring. The weight of the ring makes her hand drop a little.

<a href="#page01"><button id="page01">bookmark</button></a>
"I can't accept this." she replies.

"I can not use it any more, consider it a gift from a friend. It will protect you." She look at the ring, it looked like copper but felt like lead. She looks back over at him.

He seems to be trying to ignore her glance, but she sees him look at her from the corner of his eye. No longer able to deny the fact that he knew she'd looked at him he gave her a reassuring nod. She looked at the ring again, then at him. Then she put the ring on her right hand ring finger. She was spooked when it automatically adjusted to hit her finger. Now she knew it wouldn't come back off but out the reaction she tried anyway.

"It will come off when you no longer have a use for it." Tom reassured her. They both walked in silence until they were in school.

When the school they started toward class together but still neither spoke. She had gone off in the direction of the Science Hall when Tom lost sight of her. He had gone toward the Gym.

Brittany was already in class when Pony got there so she took the not out of her pocket and handed it to Brittany. "I was told to give this to you." Brittany opened is and it read:
<span>
I have given her the ring and I wish I could do more for her lud there is nothing left for me to do. I would like for you to wish her luck for me. One more thing, Please give her the Ever Diamond.
</span>
Brittany folds up the note and looks at Pony. Brittany thinks to herself "She doesn't look ready for the Ever Diamond."

"What's wrong?" Pony asks.

Brittany tries to respond quickly as possible, like coming out of a daze, "Nothing!"

Pony jump, not expecting such a quick response. "Meet me after class." Brittany said.

The rest of the hour was testing over Chapter 12; Genetic Structure. They both finished early, but neither looked at each other. When the bell finally ran, they waited for one another by the door. Brittany was the first to talk, "Tom wanted you to have this." She handed Pony a black oak box about 6 inches squared by 2 inches high.

Pony was reaching out her hand for the box when Brittany shoved if in her hand. "Hide it!" She had noticed Lela coming down the hall. Lela has been noted for being a rogue for a very valuable thing. The two waited until Lela was out of sight before looking at one another again. "This is the Ever Diamond. it is very valuable so protect it may be very helpful to you. There are many uses for it which I'm sure you'll discover later on. I have to get to class now, just promise me you will keep it safe."

When Brittany left Pony took the box out of her hoodie pocket and examined it carefully. It was extremely well crafted, and it was very heavy for it's size. The bell rang and she almost dropped the box. Shoving it back into her pocket, she rushed off to class.

Pony's next class was Art with Tom. She got there and saw him sitting at a table alone. She sat next to him and he looked up at her and smiled. "It's ancient and has almost unlimited uses." Tom started to tell her but saw in her eyes that she hadn't even looked at it yet. "Where is it?" he asked. She takes out the box and sets it on the table. "Go on, take a look." She slowly opens the lid. inside it is lined by fine velvet. A huge 4 inch ring was in the center, it appeared to be made out of glass. he continued "it is made out of pure diamond, making it indestructible. Now take it out of the box." Pony reaches down for it as if it were going to bite her. the ring wasn't as heavy as the box. "You may wonder why such a heavy box. I'll tell you the story."

"Many years ago everyone was into magic and war, but when the new King came into order he saw his people killing each other. He made it law that people caught using magic or battling would be sent to a dungeon, where they would be tortured for 10 years. This stopped most of the people but some were made Protectorates for the King. When the war had started, the King's army had been outnumbered by far. The King ordered the Protectorates to make him something powerful enough to protect his own country. They had made that ring and named it the Ever Diamond. The name means "indestructible diamond". The king had died before he could use the Ever Diamond. The Protectorates was what would happen to the country if the Ever Diamond was to fall in enemy hands. The Black Oak box was made with lead in the bottom of the box. Their plan was to throw the box into the sea. It would sink to the bottom and be forgotten. But it was never thrown, an enemy spy had gotten it and taken it to their king. He saw it was the most valuable thing in the country and decided not to waste anymore time on them. The poor country's population quickly grew and without warning they attacked, overthrew the king and regained the Ever Diamond. The Protectorates hid it in their king's tomb. It was recovered by Lela only 3 years ago. Frustrated because she was a rouge and couldn't use the ring, she sold it. It was pure diamond so it was extremely valuable, meaning only a rich person could buy it. Cassie, being a jeweler, was rich and the find sounded like business. She bought it, but found no real purpose for a 5lb ring so she sent it to Brittany to find out what the ring did. After a while she found the ring could see past, present and future. Just look in the center of the ring and run your finger around the ring like a clock, starting at 12. For the present it will look like a map and you pinpoint what you want to see, when put something in the ring and it teleports. Lets try it once for practice."

Pony sets the ring on the table and starts at the opposite side of the ring and moves her finger back to the 6 o'clock position. She looks in the center and sees Brittany shoving the box in her hands. She looks at Tom and he motions for her to move time forward. So she starts at 12 and moves forward to 6. She sees the ring turning red, like the color of blood. It didn't seem possible, not in the next half hour.

"It can only go so far into the future. To see the present poke the table in the center of the ring and move the ring around like a computer mouse." Try to teleport this note to Cassie, she's in Math class right now." She puts her finger in the center of the ring and the center becomes a minimap. Math was in the same hall so she found it quickly. Focusing in on Cassie and giving her the note was easier than she thought. "Very good! Cassie will also need this." handing her a blue tear shaped rock that looked like sapphire.

In the Math room Cassie had just received the note which to her seemed heavier than necessary. She opened it and found a 4 inch key and instantly recognized it as a keyblade because of the gold chain at the end of it. The note read:

<span>
I'm returning this to you for safekeeping. I hope you'll understand if I don't want the responsibility of protecting it. Pony needs a chain for the Angel's Tear Drop. Then Teagan can train her.
</span>

Cassie whispers to herself "I'm going to need the Tear Drop if I'm to put a Chain on it." And just like magic the Tear Drop appeared She grabbed for it but too late; it hit the floor. Quickly as possible she put her foot on it and slid her feet together under her desk. She looked over at the teacher to see if he had noticed, He had, he was looking straight at her. She looked back at her book and got and idea of how she would pick it up unnoticed. Acting like she read a question wrong, she erased the previous answer she wrote down. Sweeping the shreds of eraser off, she hit the pencil onto the floor and slid it over next to the stone with her feet. Then she picked them both up. Crossing her arms and hunching over the book to reread the question, she drops the stone down into the inside pocket of her jacket. Now she had to make it through the hour without being caught. The teacher no longer paid attention to her, but she didn't want to create suspicion so she raised her hand.

"Yes, Cassie?"

"Can you come check and see if I did this right?"

When the bell finally rang, Cassie was walking toward the Art room when she heard screams of fear. There was a gunshot from a handgun and she saw Pony fall to the ground. Cassie remembered her keyblade and grabbed it off the chain around her neck. After about a second the keyblade started to glow a bright mystical light. The key blade went from 4 inches to about 4 feet. No wit actually had a sharp blade. She ran up to see who the shooter was, Matthew. He started running away with something in his left hand, gun in right. Cassie started running after him but she wasn't fast enough to catch him. She stopped to see what was in his hand, it was the black oak box. Her heart began to race. If he found out whet the ring could do, why would all be killed.

Cassie turned her attention toward Pony, Brittany was already there. Cassie thought she was dead, but Brittany said the most unthinkable thing, "She'll be O.K."

"How the hell can you say something like that when she just got shot in the head!"

"Me and Tom had given her the guardian angel's ring." Cassie just stood there for a moment. 

"What about the Ever Diamond?"
