    ONE
    Tom was up at 6:00am on the Monday morning that his life would start to change. He got up and turned off the alarm, then turned on the light. Changed his clothes and got his wallet and pocket knife to put in his pocket. When he went for his change, he stopped to examine the money more closely. The 5 or 6 pennies and dimes were meaningless to him so he shoved them into his pocket. also, the old quarter he put in his pocket. What remained seemed to have deeper meaning then what everyone else was. Everyone else was money, he was memories. A Delaware quarter head a picture of Paul Revere but it was the horse he wanted. "Much rather have a Virginia." he said to himself. The Virginia quarter as he remembered it has the picture more of the horse than anything else. Another quarter of Crater Lake, he just liked it. The last quarter was a bicentennial. Last week he's traded a paper dollar for a dollar coin. the year was 2000. A half dollar had been given to him for helping and old man at an auction. He shoved the coins in his pocket.
    The clock read 6:23am and he had to leave for the bus at about 6:40am. He was 16 but didn't have a license to drive or even a permit. The bus ride wasn't that bad, it gave him time to think. There were some people that would talk to him, but he still felt alone.
    He went to the kitchen and opened the fridge to find something to eat, but he (without knowing it) had already made up his mind to grab a plum so he wouldn’t create suspicion for his step-dad.
    His brother and sister were already in where but they didn't eat anything. They sat still in front of the TV. The satellite guide covered the screen for 5 minutes without warning before they noticed what had happened. His step-dad turning it on so they couldn't see the show. (Maybe they'll get their show on and get ready to go.)
    He got his jacket on and started to get his backpack on when his little brother Dean asked where he was going. "I'm going to the bus." He walked over to the door and opened it and went out. Once out of the door he walked over to the opposite side of the porch and grabbed his Machete and started down the dirt hill.
    When his little brother and sister came down the hill he was chopping the limbs from the 2007 ice storm. It was well into April now so they weren't in the way but they needed cleaned up. When the bus came, he stabbed the Machete into the ground and ran up the stairs. His seat was 2 seats from the back on the right. He took off and sat down his backpack and took out a book and started to read. 20 to 30 minutes later a friend of his came on. Her name was Pony and her 16th birthday was last week, and he had given her a shirt with horses on it because he knew she loved horses. If was quite some time before either said a word. He could see the answer on her face before he asked, "Did your weekend go well?"
    "Yeah, it was great." in a cheery voice. That weekend her friends came over to her house to spend the night.
    "Do you think you can do me a favor?"
    "Depends, what is it?"
    "Could you give this to Brittany?" Tom holds out a note with Brittany's name drawn on it.
    She is looking a little disappointed. "Sure, I have biology with her first block."
    He sits back in his seat for a moment and starts twitting with a thing that appears heavier than an ordinary thing, he seemed to be deep in thought. I looked over a her and she was playing with her Magical Wrench. He taps her on the shoulder, and she jumps. "I would like you to have this, it will protect you." He holds out his hand in a fist so she can't see the ring inside. Trusting him she holds her hand under his, he drops the ring. The weight of the ring makes her hand drop a little.
    "I can't accept this." she replies.
    "I cannot use it any more, consider it a gift from a friend. It will protect you." She looks at the ring, it looked like copper but felt like lead. She looks back over at him.
    He seems to be trying to ignore her glance, but she sees him look at her from the corner of his eye. No longer able to deny the fact that he knew she'd looked at him he gave her a reassuring nod. She looked at the ring again, then at him. Then she put the ring on her right-hand ring finger. She was spooked when it automatically adjusted to hit her finger. Now she knew it wouldn't come back off but out the reaction she tried anyway.
    "It will come off when you no longer have a use for it." Tom reassured her. They both walked in silence until they were in school.

    When the school they started toward class together but still neither spoke. She had gone off in the direction of the Science Hall when Tom lost sight of her. He had gone toward the Gym.
    Brittany was already in class when Pony got there so she took the note out of her pocket and handed it to Brittany. "I was told to give this to you." Brittany opened is and it read:
    I have given her the ring and I wish I could do more for her lud there is nothing left for me to do. I would like for you to wish her luck for me. One more thing, please give her the Ever Diamond.
    Brittany folds up the note and looks at Pony. Brittany thinks to herself "She doesn't look ready for the Ever Diamond."
    "What's wrong?" Pony asks.
    Brittany tries to respond quickly as possible, like coming out of a daze, "Nothing!"
    Pony jump, not expecting such a quick response. "Meet me after class." Brittany said.
    The rest of the hour was testing over Chapter 12; Genetic Structure. They both finished early, but neither looked at each other. When the bell finally ran, they waited for one another by the door. Brittany was the first to talk, "Tom wanted you to have this." She handed Pony a black oak box about 6 inches squared by 2 inches high.
    Pony was reaching out her hand for the box when Brittany shoved it in her hand. "Hide it!" She had noticed Lela coming down the hall. Lela has been noted for being a rogue for a very valuable thing. The two waited until Lela was out of sight before looking at one another again. "This is the Ever Diamond. it is very valuable so protect it may be very helpful to you. There are many uses for it which I'm sure you'll discover later on. I have to get to class now, just promise me you will keep it safe."
    When Brittany left Pony took the box out of her hoodie pocket and examined it carefully. It was extremely well crafted, and it was very heavy for its size. The bell rang and she almost dropped the box. Shoving it back into her pocket, she rushed off to class.

    THREE
    Pony's next class was Art with Tom. She got there and saw him sitting at a table alone. She sat next to him and he looked up at her and smiled. "It's ancient and has almost unlimited uses." Tom started to tell her but saw in her eyes that she hadn't even looked at it yet. "Where is it?" he asked. She takes out the box and sets it on the table. "Go on, take a look." She slowly opens the lid. inside it is lined by fine velvet. A huge 4-inch ring was in the center, it appeared to be made out of glass. he continued "it is made out of pure diamond, making it indestructible. Now take it out of the box." Pony reaches down for it as if it were going to bite her. the ring wasn't as heavy as the box. "You may wonder why such a heavy box. I'll tell you the story."
    "Many years ago, everyone was into magic and war, but when the new King came into order, he saw his people killing each other. He made it law that people caught using magic or battling would be sent to a dungeon, where they would be tortured for 10 years. This stopped most of the people but some were made Protectorates for the King. When the war had started, the King's army had been outnumbered by far. The King ordered the Protectorates to make him something powerful enough to protect his own country. They had made that ring and named it the Ever Diamond. The name means "indestructible diamond". The king had died before he could use the Ever Diamond. The Protectorates was what would happen to the country if the Ever Diamond was to fall in enemy hands. The Black Oak box was made with lead in the bottom of the box. Their plan was to throw the box into the sea. It would sink to the bottom and be forgotten. But it was never thrown, an enemy spy had gotten it and taken it to their king. He saw it was the most valuable thing in the country and decided not to waste any more time on them. The poor country's population quickly grew and without warning they attacked, overthrew the king and regained the Ever Diamond. The Protectorates hid it in their king's tomb. It was recovered by Lela only 3 years ago. Frustrated because she was a rouge and couldn't use the ring, she sold it. It was pure diamond so it was extremely valuable, meaning only a rich person could buy it. Cassie, being a jeweler, was rich and the find sounded like business. She bought it, but found no real purpose for a 5lb ring so she sent it to Brittany to find out what the ring did. After a while she found the ring could see past, present and future. Just look in the center of the ring and run your finger around the ring like a clock, starting at 12. For the present it will look like a map and you pinpoint what you want to see, when put something in the ring and it teleports. Let’s try it once for practice."
    Pony sets the ring on the table and starts at the opposite side of the ring and moves her finger back to the 6 o'clock position. She looks in the center and sees Brittany shoving the box in her hands. She looks at Tom and he motions for her to move time forward. So, she starts at 12 and moves forward to 6. She sees the ring turning red, like the color of blood. It didn't seem possible, not in the next half hour.
    "It can only go so far into the future. To see the present poke the table in the center of the ring and move the ring around like a computer mouse." Try to teleport this note to Cassie, she's in Math class right now." She puts her finger in the center of the ring and the center becomes a minimap. Math was in the same hall so she found it quickly. Focusing in on Cassie and giving her the note was easier than she thought. "Very good! Cassie will also need this." handing her a blue tear shaped rock that looked like sapphire.

    FOUR
    In the Math room Cassie had just received the note which to her seemed heavier than necessary. She opened it and found a 4-inch key and instantly recognized it as a keyblade because of the gold chain at the end of it. The note read:
    I'm returning this to you for safekeeping. I hope you'll understand if I don't want the responsibility of protecting it. Pony needs a chain for the Angel's Tear Drop. Then Teagan can train her.
    Cassie whispers to herself "I'm going to need the Tear Drop if I'm to put a Chain on it." And just like magic the Tear Drop appeared She grabbed for it but too late; it hit the floor. Quickly as possible she put her foot on it and slid her feet together under her desk. She looked over at the teacher to see if he had noticed, He had, he was looking straight at her. She looked back at her book and got an idea of how she would pick it up unnoticed. Acting like she read a question wrong, she erased the previous answer she wrote down. Sweeping the shreds of eraser off, she hit the pencil onto the floor and slid it over next to the stone with her feet. Then she picked them both up. Crossing her arms and hunching over the book to reread the question, she drops the stone down into the inside pocket of her jacket. Now she had to make it through the hour without being caught. The teacher no longer paid attention to her, but she didn't want to create suspicion so she raised her hand.
    "Yes, Cassie?"
    "Can you come check and see if I did this right?"

    FIVE
    When the bell finally rang, Cassie was walking toward the Art room when she heard screams of fear. There was a gunshot from a handgun and she saw Pony fall to the ground. Cassie remembered her keyblade and grabbed it off the chain around her neck. After about a second the keyblade started to glow a bright mystical light. The key blade went from 4 inches to about 4 feet. No wit actually had a sharp blade. She ran up to see who the shooter was, Matthew. He started running away with something in his left hand, gun in right. Cassie started running after him but she wasn't fast enough to catch him. She stopped to see what was in his hand, it was the black oak box. Her heart began to race. If he found out whet the ring could do, why would all be killed.
    Cassie turned her attention toward Pony, Brittany was already there. Cassie thought she was dead, but Brittany said the most unthinkable thing, "She'll be O.K."
    "How the hell can you say something like that when she just got shot in the head!"
    "Me and Tom had given her the guardian angel's ring." Cassie just stood there for a moment. 
    "What about the Ever Diamond?" I saw him run away with the Black Oak Box.”
    Brittany look sat her then looks at Pony then Pony holds up her hand; in it is the Ever Diamond. Her atm suddenly goes slack, and the ring falls out of her hand. Cassie and Brittany ignored the ring. Brittany took out her cell phone and dialed 911. The bell rand but neither moved.

    SIX
    When the ambulance and police arrived; the two girls told the police what had happened while the medics got Pony into the ambulance. They knew very well that would happen if the mentioned the Ever Diamond, they would be worse off than Pony. “Do you know of any reason that he would do this?” One policeman asked. The two girls looked at one another as if searching go the answer. Brittany shook her head. “If you think of anything else you can call us.” And one of the men handed the girls a card with his name and number on it. Something catches Brittany’s eye but she tries not to look. She motions for Cassie to hide the Ever Diamond. Cassie looks over at the ring from the corner of her eye. At first, she didn’t move but when the police man turns to look around at the scene. Very quickly Cassie grabs something out of her pocket and hands it to Brittany. The police man turns around and looks at them. “When she (pointing at Pony) wakes up could you give this to her.” Brittany said holding out her hand to show a tear shaped sapphire with a short silver chain at the top of it. “Tell her it’s an Angel’s tear drop.”
    As Brittany distracted the policeman Cassie had walked over and picked up the Ever Diamond., Cassie turned to Brittany and looked pale, but did the best she could not to show it. The ambulance had been there longer than necessary and it was a relief when it finally left. “I don’t see why I couldn’t” the policeman responded after a little thought. He got into his car and followed the ambulance out of sight. Brittany looked at Cassie, “What, is something wrong?”
    “It’s the ring, it’s red like blood.” And she held out the ring to show Brittany. It didn’t just look like blood, it was blood, but only on the inside. “I’ve never seen it do that before.” Brittany said trying to break the silence. Cassie still didn’t speak, she just stood staring at the thing in her hand. Slowly she started to speak, “I know someone who has.”
    “Who?”
    Cassie looks up, “Lela”

    SEVEN
    They take off running toward the history hall. Stopping short of the door to hear the announcement on the intercom. “Intruder is no longer on campus. You must report to your 3rd block class before lunch. Thank you.” Cassie looks at Brittany “she’ll be here next. Let’s just wait for her.” Tom walks out with the teacher following behind him. He looks at them “What happened to Pony?” The teacher looks at them as if to see if they were guilty or not.
    “Are you in on this too?”
    Brittany responds, “In on what?”
    “You two can join Tom.” The teacher said as he pushes the three of them toward the principal’s office.
    Brittany leans over to Cassie, “It’s your turn to get us out of this one.”
    “I don’t think there’s any way out.” Cassie whispers back. They all enter the principal’s office. He’s turned around in his chair. “I would like to talk to them alone.” he said. The teacher leaves making the room silent. “I have heard what you did, Cassie. The policeman told me that you tried to catch the intruder, is that right?”
    She had to think for a moment, “Am I in trouble for using my keyblade? Nobody was really hurt. “Yes, that is correct.”
    “I saw you two,” pointing at Cassie and Brittany, “you did very well trying to catch the man who did this, for that I’m going to cut you a break.”
    They felt their hearts race. “What do you mean?” Cassie asked
    “I mean I know about your magic,” searching for the word he swings his hands wildly in the air. “THINGS!” he suddenly said. “But if the teacher finds out I still have no choice but to take action.”
    Cassie feels her hand hit the ring. It somehow reminded her of the shooter, Matthew. “Are you going to help us catch the shooter or not?”
    “No, I don’t believe it is my job to do that. What I can do it give you the name of someone who can help you. Have you heard of Steven?” They shake their heads. “He is a good trapper; he can make a trap to catch this guy.  Just think of how fast we could ger him behind bars.”
    Brittany’s cell phone rang. “May I answer that?” the principle nods his head. She opens it and answers, “Hello?” On the other line you could hear it was another girl in panic.
    “Have you heard what happened to Pony yet?”
    “No, I SAW what happened!”
    “Oh sorry.”
    “Is that all you called for?” Brittany asks.
    “No, I called to tell you I’m at the hospital.”
    “Do you know where she is yet?”
    “She’s in room 314.”
    “I’ll be there in a few minutes. Cassie will stay here and talk to Lela about the Ever Diamond.”
    “What about the Ever Diamond?”
    “Well, it’s blood red.”
    “Should I come?”
    “No, you stay there.” And Brittany hung up without saying good bye.
    Cassie looks at Brittany, “Who was that?”
    “It was Teagan, she’s at the hospital. I want you to stay here and talk to Lela.” Cassie agrees.
    “What about me?” Tom asks.
    “You should go see Steven.” Brittany tells him. She looks over at the principle, “You won’t tell anyone anything will you?”
    “Of course not.”

    CHAPTER I
    Brittany makes it appear that she’s going out on a lunch date with Tom so that she can leave the school. She drops Tom off at Steven’s house and goes on toward the hospital. When she arrives, there are many rain clouds in the sky. “I hope it doesn’t rain; she says to herself as she starts up the walk. When inside she sees the help desk. “Excuse me, where is room 314?” The lady at the desk points to Brittany’s right without looking up. “Thank you.” Brittany said. She goes and reads the numbers aloud. “300, 302, 304, … wow, it’s really quiet in here… 310, 312.” She moves to the nest door, “here it is” She quietly opens the door, trying not to disturb anyone. As soon as she was inside, she can tell it Pony’s, there are 3 pictures of her and her horse. She heard a voice that she didn’t recognize, but she knew she had heard it before. She took a few more steps. The voice had been the policeman from the school.
    “She had just woken up about 10 minutes ago. As promised, I gave her the rea drop. I was just telling her about my horses from when I was a young child. She seems to be going well.” There were a few moments of silence. “I guess I should get back to work.” And with that said he leave.
    Brittany walks over to her bedside and softly says, “How are you, Pony?” She had expected to see her head wrapped up, but it wasn’t.
    “I think I’ll live.” She says weakly. Out in the hallway Brittany can hear the Policemen’s voice again, the two look up to see him and Teagan enter the room.
    The policemen foes to Pony’s bedside and looks at the area on her forehead where she was shot.
    Teagan could tell that she didn’t like him looking at her like… evidence. She isn’t an object you can put in a little plastic baggie and take to court. “Leave he alone!” The policeman stops and look sat her. “She was shot in the head, and didn’t die.  Is that official enough?”
    “What about the killer?”
    “Attempt of murder.”
    “Good enough for me.” And he writes down what she said and leaves. As he opens the door a nurse comes in.
    “Would you like some lunch?” the nurse asks. Pony looks over at the schedule board to see the nurse’s name. It reads Mrs. Smith.
    “Sure.”
    Brittany looks at Teagan and says, “We should go get something to eat too.

    NINE
    Back at the school Cassie is sitting next to Lela talking. She had the Ever Diamond in her had showing Lela. Lela was acting careful not to touch the ring. “This will ‘learn’ from any jewelry. It wasn’t the guardian angel ring that saved her, it was the Ever Diamond. The two must have touched at some point.
    Cassie says, “she had them in the same hand when we found her.”
    Lela continues, “That’s it then. The blood in the ring is her very soul. The only reason she is alive is because she had the Ever Diamond.”
    “So now what do we do?” Cassie asks.
    “The last time this happened was when the King died. To free the King’s soul the kingdom had to find the man who killed the King, and that man was to be killed.”
    Cassie goes pale thinking about having to kill someone, “I can’t just kill a person!”
    “I overheard you talking in the office. Steven will succeed. If he doesn’t, I can do it for you. But there may be more difficulties that this though. The difference is that Pony didn’t die. So, this may not be the true solution.”
    “So even you didn’t know the answer?” Cassie asks. Lela says, “I will not promise you anything.” Lela gets out a dollar from her purse, “Here go get you something to eat.” Cassie pushes her hand back and shakes her head. Lela tells her, “You must ear, it will help you think.” This time Cassie takes the dollar and goes over to the snack machine. Reading through the choices she gets some fruit crackers and puts then in her jacker. She looks around. Someone taps her on the shoulder and she jumps.
    “Hi, my name is Bo and I’m the police officer’s son, and he told me to make sure that you know everything that we find out about Pony’s shooter. This here is my girlfriend, Kelsey.”
    Kelsey takes over from there, “I’m Pony’s nurse’s daughter and I will be keeping you informed on Pony’s condition.”:
    Both Bo and Kelsey gave Cassie their cards with name, number and address on them.
    “How is Pony?” Cassie asks.
    “She’s healing incredibly fast.” Kelsey says with surprise. “Anything else?”
    “No, not at the moment.”
    Bo tries to cheer her up by pointing at another card, “Ring then digits right there to chat.” And they walk back into the crowd.
    From behind Cassie gets grabbed by someone, hand over her mouth she is drug into an unoccupied classroom. The attacker tried to take the keyblade from her necklace but she already had it in her hand. She bits him in the face with the handle of the keyblade and knocks him out. She goes over to the door. It’s locked, but how? She quickly realized he turned the handle around so it locked from the inside. This meant he had a plan to get out, or the key. She has to keep him alive.

    TEN
    Tom was over at Steven’s house talking business. “I’m not exactly sure what’s going on yet but I was told we need someone to help catch a man, a killer not less. Brittany had filled him in on some details but she didn’t say who was shot, so he still didn’t know what the big deal was.
    “What kind of killer?”
    “One that kills people!”
    “No, I mean where, when why how, who and I hope people.”
    Tom thinks for a moment then quickly says, “Matthew, with a handgun at school for an invaluable object.”
    “I’ll do it but it comes with a price, say about 100 dollars today plus 25 for each extra day.”
    “Is that dead or alive?” Tom asks.
    “That’s if I even catch him.”
    “We want him alive.”
    “Then $65 a day, plus $250 for when I catch him.”
    “Ok, let me write that down.” Tom takes out another piece of paper and writes it down. “May I use your phone?”
    “Go right ahead.” Steven says.
    Tom goes into the kitchen and picks up the phone and dials Brittany’s phone number.

    ELEVEN
    At the hospital Teagan and Brittany are headed back to Pony’s room where Brittany’s cell phone rings. She answers.” Hello?”
    “Yeah, it’s Tom.”
    “And what did Steven say?”
    “He said he’d do it for $65 a day plus $250 for when he catches the guy.”
    “Tell him it is not a deal; we’ll pick you up in about 30 minutes.” They were outside Pony’s door when they were talking.
    From Pony’s room, “was that Tom?”
    Brittany tried to change the subject, “Have you named the new colt yet?”
    “Yes, we named it Firewing.” Realizing what Brittany was trying to do she added “Who told you that?”
    “Ok, I’ll tell you the truth, we haven’t told Tom you were the on shot. We didn’t want him to worry about you.
    Mrs. Smith came in, “Sorry, you can’t stay here right now. You may wait outside the room.”
    “No, we should be going.” Teagan said. The two girls picked up Tom and went back to the school. Lunch was over now but none of the went to class. They wanted to talk to Cassie. She should have been in Biology right now so that’s where they went. After asking the teachers where she was and not finding her, they knew there was trouble.

    TWELVE
    Cassie had managed to turn on the lights to see the attacker, Matthew. Her heart raced but she managed enough courage to disarm him and found straps to tie him up with. When he came to, he couldn’t find any weapons to cut loose, so he eventually quit struggling. “I would never have thought.” He said.
    “Thought what?”
    “The weakest link would be the one to catch me and keep me here like she owned me.”
    “The only think you are needed for is to open this door.”
    “Brilliant plan, wasn’t it? Turning the knob around so you can’t escape even if I lose a fight.”
    “What do you want with me?” Cassie asks.
    “You know what I want. I want what’s in you pocket there. (point to her pocket), I want the Ever Diamond.”
    “You’re not getting it!”
    Brittany’s voice can be heard, “Cassie is that you?”
    “Brittany, I’m in here!” Cassie hits the door with the palm of her hand. Brittany opens the door and hugs her. She sees Matthew and says, “Cassie, oh my goodness, we caught him, I mean, you caught him!”
    Cassie turns back and looks at Matthew and says “now that we’re all here I think Mr. Matthew has some explaining to do.”
    Matthew remarks. “Explaining? To the lot of you? I will do no such thing!” he stops to think for a moment. “You haven’t told Tom what happened yet, have you?”
    Tom looks around, “What happened?”
    Matthew says, “It was I who shot Pony.”
    Tom draws his knife and goes for Matthew, but Cassie stops him. “Just listen, all of you.” She holds out the Ever Diamond making sure she is far from Matthew. “This blood is Pony’s soul and from what Lela tells me, Pony must kill Matthew. Then her soul will be restored.” Tom lowers his knife. “Maybe you could just go to class we’ll watch him.” He hesitates then leaves, shutting the door behind him. Only a moment to late did the girls realize they were locked in with him. He starts laughing at them, “I didn’t know being tied up could be so much fun.”
    Teagan says, “Shut up. You’re just as stuck as we are.”
    “That is there you are wrong. You see I have a key.”
    “And you can’t use it as long as you’re tied up.”
    “True enough.”
    The rest of the hour glass goes by and nobody opens the door.

    THIRTEEN
    It is now after school. Cassie takes out the fruit crackers (now thankful that she got them) and hands some to the other girls and she keeps one extra. “Why do you get more?” Teagan asks Cassie.
    “I don’t. Matthew needs to eat too, right?” And Cassie gives the other two a wink. They smile because they are all bored and want something entertaining to do. Teasing Matthew sounded like fun at the time. So, they took turns teasing him with a strawberry flavored cracker but that didn’t las long so Cassie just fed it to him. This was the most fun they had all evening. Later when it was about 5:00pm the girls ran across a problem, there wasn’t a bathroom in the room. Teagan was watching Matthew while Cassie and Brittany were looking for the key Matthew said he had. Suddenly Cassie looks at Matthew and asks, “Matthew, have I found it?” Then Cassie looks up at Teagan.
    “What? Where is it?” She asks.
    “Strap him in better, you have a belt.” Teagan looks at Cassie but takes her belt off anyways. After the belt is off of Teagan and around Matthew. Cassie takes the necklace with the keyblade off so she doesn’t activate it. Slowly she puts it into the door lock, and turns the key. The door opens. All of the girls rush out of the room and to the bathroom.
    “Who taught you that?” Brittany asks.
    “Nobody, I have to try something.” After the girls get out of the bathroom they return to where they had Matthew tied up. He wasn’t there, the straps were cut and Teagan’s belt set on the floor. There was a key in the seat where he had been.
    Brittany picks it up and examines it. “It seems to be an ordinary key. He was telling the truth.” Teagan put her belt back on. Cassie gets the handgun that she had taken from Matthew out of the hiding spot.
    Cassie starts to speak “I met these two people…” someone in the halls calls out and she breaks mid-sentence.
    “Cassie, we need you and your friends to come with us.” It was Bo. The three girls go with Bo to his dad’s police car. “Dad said I could use his cat to take you to Tom’s house. We need to question you with the family.”

    FOURTEEN
    When they arrive at Tom’s house, they see Tom sitting on the porch crying. Bo quietly asks the girls, “He really did love her, didn’t he?” The girls stood watching Tom helplessly. None of them attempt to answer Bo. After Bo finds that they won’t answer to this, he asks Tom, ”Do you love Pony?”
    Tom starts to cry more now. Through the tears he manages to utter a single word, “Yes.”
    “Lela said if you really do love Pony you should find the Holy Time Charm. Have any of you heard of it?”
    Brittany speaks up. “I have. It lets one to go back in time and change one thing. But the Ever Diamond is not affected by it.”
    Bo says to them, “go to Lela tomorrow and she’ll tell you how to save Pony.”: Bo looks at his watch, it reads 7:32 pm. “You all should get some rest.”
    Tom, trying not to cry anymore. “You’re right.” And he gets up and starts towards the house door.
    Bo speaks up to Tom, ”You should tell you mother that you will be staying over with some friends tomorrow. “Then looking at the girls, “I’ll drive you home.” And motions then to the police car. When he drops each one off, he tells them the came as he told Tom, “Tell you parents that you’ll spend the night with some friends.” They tell their parents and go to bed. Tom sees Pony getting shot again. He wakes up and goes back to sleep with a picture of them riding horses.

    FIFTEEN
    The four of them; Tom, Brittany, Cassie, and Teagan; awake early the next morning and agreed to meet at Jiffy Mart. Once there they started to talk about what they thought Lela would tell them. Brittany’s cell phone starts to ring, she answers it. “Hello?”
    “Yes, this is Lela, telling you, you’re late for class!”
    She hangs up and checks the time. “We’re late for class! Hurry up!” and the four of them pair up because Brittany and Teagan were the two that drove. Cassie with Teagan and Tom with Brittany. They drive to school and run inside. The principal stops them.
    “Come to my office.”
    Teagan responds. “Sorry we’re late.”
    “It’s not about you being late.” Surprised they followed him to his office. Once inside they see Lela sitting in a chair.
    The principal instructs, “Please sit, Lela needs to talk to you.” Each of them selects a seat.
    Lela begins, “Bo spoke to you about the Holy Time Charm, right?” They nod, “It is hidden somewhere in the Eastern Lands. For this quest I think I should meet someone.”
    They hadn’t noticed but someone was in the corner and Lela motions for them to come over. They now see that it is a well fit female. Lela continues, “This is Jaimee a warrior, she will help protect you along the way. You should travel to Crater Mountain, on you way you will see a good friend of mine. He’s a Blacksmith by the name of Kord. He should be in the first village you come to. The village will help you get supplies. Any questions?”
    “Will you be there?” Brittany asks.
    “I will be there, but I can’t come with you. This is Tom’s quest, but you are here to help him. I’m not allowed to do this but I will teleport you to the village.”
    The four of them see a bright light and then appear in an old fashion hotel.

    Chapter II
    They all look at each other. Each notice that they have armor and weapons. Brittany has a light, silky, pink skirt, and a small silver dagger in maroon colored belt. Teagan is wearing blue jean shorts and a short blue jean jacket. She has light but durable boots on. Her hands have gauntlets of steel. Cassie has studded leather and her keyblade. Jaimee is waring ring mail with a helm. She has a two-handed sword in a sheaf on her back. Tom has a quiver on his back and a bow upon his shoulder. He’s wearing a cotton T-shirt and long silky shorts. They all notice each other but none notice each other but none notice Lela. Someone walks over and they see it is Lela. She is about, 5 foot 2 inches now. Long red hair goes to the lower part of her back. Her eyes are a deep blue. She seems light weight but strong none the less. She appears about 19 years of age and she has a kind looking face. They can see a flame shaped birthmark to one side just below her breast. They wouldn’t have notice this if she had more than a bikini on. She has a fair tan.
    “I hope you enjoy your stay in Blackshire. You should go into the village and look for supplies you’ll need during your travel.” She gives them all some gold coins. “You should discuss it among yourselves before buying anything.” They all go out into the market.

    SIXTEEN-B
    Meanwhile at the hospital…
    Bo is in the elevator talking to Kelsey.” I want Pony to know that her friends have went with Lela to find the Holy Time Charm.”
    Kelsey looks at Bo and asks, “Did Tom go?”
    Bo looks at her, “Yes, and tell her that Tom said he loves her.” The elevator comes to the 1st floor and then get out. “You’ll tell her, right?”
    “Yeah.” And she walks toward 314 while Bo goes out of the hospital doors; he gets into the police car and drives away.
    Kelsey walks down the hall until she comes to 314. She goes in and introduces herself, “Hi, my name is Kelsey. I’m the nurse’s daughter and I’ll going to sub for her. Bo, my boyfriend is the policeman’s son and he wanted me to tell you that Tom and your friends went with Lela to find the Holy Time Charm, and Tom says he loves you.”  There was a fourth picture now, a small shire colt.
    “That picture was taken yesterday,” Pony begins, “his name is Firestar.”
    Kelsey looks at the picture closer. There seems to be golden horse shoes on him. She picks up the pictures to make sure It isn’t a glare. They are still there. “Pony?”
    “What?”
    But when Kelsey blinks, they are gone. “Never mind” she says a little uneasy.
    “Let’s get started. Have you been to the bathroom yet?” Kelsey says trying to sound professional.
    “Yes, but strange to think I need to go again.” Then she adds more aggressively “after four hours.”
    “Sorry I was late.” She sees Pony trying to get up. “Let me help you.” And she grabs a hold of Pony’s left hand and pulls her up. Once on her feet Kelsey Hans Pony a small cup with a screw on lid. “I hope you know what to do with it.” Pony toys with the cup in her hand and then looks over at Kelsey.
    “You just didn’t give me what I think you gave me, did you?”
    “If you’re thinking of a pee cup, you’re right.”
    Pony has almost no trouble walking to the bathroom before closing the door. Kelsey hears her say to herself, “this sucks.” Pony shuts the door but Kelsey calls back,
    “I don’t make the rules, I just follow them.” from the other side of the door, Pony smarts off, “Rules are made to be broken.”
    Kelsey rolls her eyes and thinks to herself “she’ll do what I tell her to anyhow so I don’t have to argue.”  From the bathroom Kelsey can hear Pony peeing now.
    When Pony comes out, she hands Kelsey the cup with the lid screwed on good. Kelsey takes the cup, “You can rest now.” And Kelsey leaves the room shutting the door behind her. She goes down the hall toothed the lab where she labels the cup.
    Pony female Room 314
    She sets it down and leaves the room.

    Back at the hotel…
    Lela was waiting for the return of the others. She was flipping a gold piece and catching it; she sits it on the bar table and added another one. The bar keeper looked at her for a moment Then took the gold and gave her a glass of wine. She took it and thanked the man.
    Outside in the market…
    Jamie had been to this village before, so she knew where Kord the blacksmith was, “I think it should just need a touch up, “she says handing him the blade.
    “Actually, I’ve been saving something for you.” He pulls out a large two-handed sword, “it’s one of a kind it’s believed to have the feather of a Phoenix inside the handle. So, when you grab the handle, it becomes fiery.”
    “Do I owe you anything?”
    “Just a favor. Could you take this to an old beggar guy by the inn?”
    “Sure.” And he hands her a sword that looked like it came from the very pit of Hell. It was black, jagged and had spikes all over it.

    EIGHTEEN
    At the front of the inn…
    Jaimee sets the sword at the man’s feet.
    He looks up, “Thank you very much, it is the only think left in my name. From what I hear you must be Jaimee, Tom’s friend. If you see him tell him I want to talk to him.”
    There’s a smash and sound of glass breaking from inside the inn. Jaimee gets up to go look inside, but the old man stops her, “Best if you stay out here, if there is a fight in there and you go in, you will be in a fight too.”
    “Maybe you’re right, I’ll go find Tom.” And somehow without knowing it she started towards the stables.
    At the stables…
    Jaimee quietly walks up behind Tom; he’s feeding the horses some carrots that he bought.
    “You really miss her, don’t you?”
    “Yeah.”
    “Well since you don’t want to talk, the old man by the inn does.”
    “He can wait I have one more carrot and I’m not about to waste my money, and speaking of money what did you buy?”
    “It was more of a trade,” she pulls out the sword, and it ignites, “Sweet, isn’t it?”
    “Put it up, you scaring the horses!”
    “Sorry!” she puts it back into the sheaf. 
    “I’m done anyway.” They walk back to the inn where the old man is sitting with his sword in his lap.

    NINETEEN
    “Hello, Tom.”
    “How do you know my name?”
    “I know much more than you name. I also know about your little girlfriend too.”
    “What do you know about Pony?” Tom quickly asks.
    “She would be very disappointed if you were to cheat on her. Word of advice, don’t completely trust Lela.”
    Jaimee gets a worried look on her face “Why not?”
    “I’ve heard that she’ll use herself to get anything she wants from a man.,”
    “And what do I have that she wants?” Tom asks looking himself over.
    “She wants this, “the old man said taking 2 copper chains off of his wicked sword. “One for you and one for Pony. These necklaces allow a couple to trade abilities of even bodies.”
    “But how do I give one to Pony?”
    “There’s a small cottage on the edge of the town. There’s a sorceress there, she’ll teleport you to Pony. I believe her name is Ericka. Me and Jaimee should find the rest of your pals.”
    Tom goes off toward the edge of town. Jaimee helps the old man up, “So what kind of sword if that, sir?”
    “Please call me Buck, and Lela gave it to me, she says it is from the devil himself, I had to agree.”
    “Cassie is at the Jewler’s shop, would you like to meet her?”
    “I love to meet everybody, I’s good to see a new face for a change.” They walk on up the street past 2 more shops.

    TWENTY
    Cassie was where Jaimee said she would be, Brittany was with her. “Brittany, Cassie this is Buck, Buck this Cassie and Brittany.” Jaimee said pointing to them respectively.
    “Good to meet you girls.” Cassie jumps slightly at the sight of Buck’s sword, “What in the heck is that?” pointing at the sword.
    Jaimee comments, “I knew it came from Hell, but mines still better.” She pulls it out and as before it becomes engulfed in flames. The 3 of them look at the fiery sword, even the shop, owner looks at is. 
    Brittany trying not to look at it any more asks, “Where did you get that?”
    The shop owner answers with a strange accent, “Kord give it to her, she saved him from the bad girl.”
    Cassie asks “What bad girl?”
    The jeweler replies “That Lela, she always causing trouble. Now scram! You no good for business.”
    Jaimee puts her sword up. Cassie picks up a decorative piece (a horse jumping over a horseshoe) and pays 9 gold pieces for it. “I’m sure Tom would like this.”
    “We should go look for Teagan first.” Brittany suggests. “I think she went to the training field.”
    Buck stops them, “I should get back to the inn.” Jaimee responds, “See you there.”

    TWENTY-ONE
    Out at the training field the 3 girls see 20 of so knights paired up with weapons of choice. The only thing that told them who was Teagan was the boots, she didn’t have the gauntlets anymore, she had a sword and shield with fill plate armor and coat of mail, upon her head she has a full helm. It doesn’t look like she can even move but to their surprise she can swing the sword. Her partner was the instructor and he had shorts and a tank-top on with just a sword. He swung for her head but she ducked down behind the tower shield making it look like her head was cut off. Then the shield fell on her. She laid flat on her back, the 3 girls were relieved to hear her speak, “Help, I have fallen and can’t get back up.” They finally realized the armor actually was too heavy for her to get up. Then Jaimee goes over to where Teagan was laying and the other 2 followed.
    “Hi Jaimee.”
    “Need some help up?”
    The instructor comes over, “Your training is over, take the armor and weapons off and put them back into the shop please.”
    Teagan looks back at Jaimee, “sure, then you can help me out of this.”
    Jaimee grabs her hands and pulls while Cassie and Brittany push her up by the shoulders.

    TWENTY-TWO
    Meanwhile…
    Tom had just arrived where Ericka was. “Excuse me, are you Ericka?”
    “Yeah, you want something?”
    “I was told you could teleport this to a girl named Pony at the hospital.” Showing the necklace. 
    “I’m not busy, so how about we teleport there together?”
    Uneasily he says, “I suppose I wouldn’t hurt anything.”
    “I’ll need an extra scroll, could you hand me one.” She says pointing to the shelf. He hands her one and she sticks it in her belt under her robe. “The scroll may not be as good as the real thing but it is good enough.” She tosses the scroll out away from her and called out “teleport”. When it hit the ground, it turned into a portal. She was right, it’s not the same. “You have to go first because you know where you want it to take you.” He walks over and puts his hand in to make sure it wouldn’t hurt him; slowly be walks through with Ericka behind him.

    TWENTY-THREE
    At the hospital Pony was sitting on her bed when the portal opened and Ton and Ericka stepped out. The portal closed as soon as Ericka stepped out. The first voice they hear comes from the doorway. It was Kelsey, “I didn’t know you had visitors. I’ve got your test results back and it seems you’re in perfect health, which brings the question; how did you recover so fast?” Pony holds her hand to show then the blue sapphire. “Great magic charms, and what should I write on your records?”
    Tom answers for her, “2 weeks.”
    Sure thing, I just can’t allow the public know about all to this magic stuff. Anyway, you’re free to go.”
    They hear Bo call from the hall, “No she’s not, not yet. There has been some evidence found but no leads so we should give this back to you.” He pulls the black oak box out of a gallon sized baggie.” They checked for prints, and couldn’t find any. Inside was a small hand written book, we kept the original and made a copy for you.” He hands them a small book stapled together. “Maybe you can make use of the information.”
    Pony, already holding the box takes the book and hands it to Tom.
    “If we find any more on this man, we’ll let you know.”
    “Thank you.” Pony says
    Then Kelsey and Bo walk out the door together, leaving Ericka, Tom and Pony alone in the room.
    Ericka speaks first, “We should get back it’s getting late.” And she grabs the scroll from the belt under her robe. As before she tosses it and calls “teleport” and the portal opens. Ericka goes through first. Tom reaches out and takes Pony’s hand and says, “It’s okay, it doesn’t hurt.” And the two walk through the portal.

    TWENTY-FOUR
    Chapter III
    When they came out of the portal it was dusk and people started to do inside for the night. “You have a place to stay for the night?” Ericka asked.
    Tom answers, “I think we are to stay at the inn.”
    “Then you better go, it’s not safe at night you know.”
    “She’s probably right, let’s go.” And Tom took Pony by the hand and walked, Pony talking about what happened at the hospital. Tom tried to listen but most of what she said he already knew. Only one thing he didn’t know about. “… and My dad came and gave me this horseshoe.” She takes a 1-inch horseshoe made of gold out of her jean pocket. H holds his free hand out and she carefully sets it in his hand. He looks at it closer. It was perfect, as if made for an actual horse. He hands it back to her.
    “I know I’ve seen one just like it before.”
    “The man that let us borrow his stallion had it.”
    They went on talking until they came to the inn. Buck was still outside with his sword. He looked up at Tom then to Pony, and they stop to look at him. Tom held out his hand, “Come inside, you shouldn’t be out at night.”
    “Sorry, but I haven’t got money.”
    Tom hands him about 20 gold pieces. “Now you have some money.”
    The old man gets up and looks Tom in the eyes, “God is very pleased with what you have done, many thanks my friend.” And he walks inside.
    Tom tries to follow but Pony grabs his hand and he turns, “That was so sweet, to give that poor man some money so he can sleep inside. I think you deserve a reward.” She gets closer to him and starts to give him a kiss… the door opens and the innkeeper calls “are you two coming in? I’m locking it.” They walk inside and sit where the rest of the group are chatting. Teagan is speaking… and I sold the gauntlets to get the money to have the boots steel plated.”
    “So, what did you do with the money, Brittany?” Lela asked.
    “Well, I got some jeans this shirt and this for Pony.” And Brittany hands Pony another golden horse shoe.
    “That is the same horse shoe that is on this, “Cassie says holding the decorative piece. After she looks at the piece for a minute, she slips the horse shoe free, and hands it to Pony which now 3 golden horse shoes.
    Buck comes over form a lonely corner table, “Sorry, I couldn’t help but to overhear you, may I see them.” He looks at the table where they lay. “You know, there’s a story behind those horse shoes.”
    Pony responds, “No, sir”
    “Please my name is Jim Buck, and yours should be Pony, right?”
    “Uh, yeah. Please tell us a story.”

    TWENTY-FIVE
    “Ok, I see you have 3 horseshoes but there is another. One all collected a chosen horse fitted with these becomes a trained war horse, stronger faster, smarter. There was a King here and he had a silver smith make these and when his kingdom was over ruled, he lost them with the Ever Diamond.
    You have heard of the Ever Diamond, haven’t you?” Cassie sets the Ever Diamond on the table and Pony sets the Black Oak box on the table. “Why is it red?”
    Lela answers “Pony was shot while holding it.”
    “This is not good; you can say it saved her life of you can say it ended it. She is not immortal.” Pony looks like she just seen a ghost. “Without a soul, she has no reason to die. To die is to be considered God’s greatest privilege. The Lord won’t allow even on soul to be wasted.”
    Pony trying not to believe on word he said about her immortality asks, “What about the fourth horse shoe?”
    “Oh yes. The fourth shoe. How about I make a deal, I’ll tell you for a glass of wine.”
    Lela stands up, “Sounds good, and I believe I’ll have a bottle.” She calls to the barman. She sits back down and he brings their drinks. She pays him 6 gold and says to Buck, “Please, continue.”
    “Well, when the king died and they buried the Ever Diamond in his tomb they also put one horse shoe down there.” Lela gets a strange satisfied look on her face and starts drinking her beer. Brittany and Jaimee get up “We’re going to bed before she gets drunk.”
    Teagan gets up, “I should get some rest too.” And the 3 of them go upstairs.
    “Is it still there?” Pony asks.
    “No, I think when Lela stole all of the treasure she sold it to that Ericka lady. You should see if she has it tomorrow.” 
    Lela is at the end of the table laughing stupidly. Cassie gets up. Buck stops her. “Give Pony the ring.” And Cassie hands pony the ring, then goes upstairs. “Give me the box.” Pony hands him the box, then from under the table she takes Tom by the hand with the Ever Diamond in the other, “Ready for bed sweetie?” He gets up and follows her upstairs, but not before seeing the barman hand Buck and katana, “It’s for protection from her.” Buck walks over to Lela and says to himself, “Lord, forgive me.” And he hits her in the back of the head with the handle.
    “Tom, come on.” Pony calls to him, and he rushes into the room, shuts the door and locks it.

    TWENTY-SIX

    Around 2:00am…
    Every one was in bed except one man, he had been watching Lela all day. When Lela came around the man gave her a drunk smile. He was wearing a pair of jeans and button up shirt and a cowboy hat. She came over and gets close to him, “you naughty little cowboy you. You should be in bed, but since you’re not could you tuck me in?” and she motions him upstairs into an empty room. She wraps her arms around him, “I want you in that bed ready for me when I get back, here a head start.” She unbuttons his pants and then she goes into the bathroom. She turns and then she goes into the bathroom. She turns on the light and slowly unties her bikini top. She looks in the mirror at her breast. Still watching the mirror, she unties her bottoms. They fall to the floor; she slowly moves her hands from her hips crossing over one another to touch her breast but they stop short on the birthmark. She looks down at the mark then back at the mirror. She has a vision in the mirror of the Swelevox being swung at her by a huge demon. The mirror breaks and she falls to the floor. Quickly she moves back to her room where the man is in the bed under a sheet. she pulls the sheet off and positions herself upon him. He looks at her breast then into her eyes. “You can touch, “and he reaches for them and she finisher her statement, “but gently.” Carefully he reached out and touches them. Something catches Lela’s eye, a single drop of blood on his chest. She whispers to herself, “blood.” Without moving her eyes, she reaches under the pillow and grabs a small dagger. The man asks, “what’s wrong.” Am I not good enough? All she says is “BLOOD!” and she stabs him and twists the blade then slits his throat. Blood covered her while the man bleeds to death, he looks at the man sadly and gets herself off of him., she sets still for about an hour to allow the blood to dry, preventing if from getting on the floor or anything else. Its early now about 5:30am and Lela goes to the shower to wash off the blood nobody would suspect anything at this time. 

    TWENTY-SEVEN
    Once inside and started washing she finds a long cut on the underside of her right arm and she figures it was from the mirror. She cleans up quickly and washes her blood red hair carelessly but she doesn’t get out. She turns the shower off and runs her a bath. When the water is ready, she lies down and relaxes, her hand finds the glass from the mirror missing. She finds her razor and shaves her legs. After she’s done shaving, she rubs her legs to make sure the felt right, no cuts or anything. Slowly she works her way up her legs, she looks to make sure nobody is in the room with her, then she starts playing with herself. 

    TWENTY-EIGHT
    About 6:00am in Tom and Pony’s room, Tom is reading the book Boi had given them. Pony is still asleep but she occasionally turns over.
    Outside the book it reads:
    KING ALBERT
    Upon opening the book, he sees it is a journal, written by a low-class scribe. The first date reads:
    “The men for my country continue to use magic and consistently quarrel; among the many dead I found a young girl crying over the shoulder of her dead parents. Such a perfect little girl I thought, she always would pray and use manners, but her name did not suit her: Lela. We changed it to …”
    “Oh, you’re awake. Time to eat if you’re going to.” Lela says, Tom shits the book and looks up at her.
    “Okay.” He says and Lela goes downstairs. Tom touches Pony on the shoulder and she motions to suggest that she’s awake.
    “Food’s ready.” She opens her eyes and rolls over to face him, “I bet Food won’t come to me when I call it will it?” She asks with a half-smile. “Not likely, but you can try.”
    “FOOD!” she shouts, then smiles at him. They laugh. “Come on get up.”

    TWENTY-NINE
    When Tom and Pony were down stairs, they saw Lela being hand cuffed by Officer Bergan. Lela seems to be yelling nonsense, “… my waffle, but I didn’t know refusing to pay was a crime. I’ll pay for the burnt black thing if it makes you happy, but I still want another.” Bergan pushes her out the door and she starts fighting him uselessly, “I want my damn waffle, and I won’t cooperate until I get it.” But he shoved her into his police car. He went back and got her a waffle but didn’t give it to her. Instead, he looks at her and begins his speech.
    “You are under arrest for the murder of Bill Jones you have the right to remain silent, anything you say and do can and will be held against you in a court of law. You have a right to an attorney, if you can not afford one, one will be appointed to you…”
    Pony from the doorway watches him, Tom joins, then the rest of their party.
    “Can I have the waffle now?” Lela asks.
    “If it satisfies you.” And he sticks it in her mouth, gets in the car and leaves.
    Shortly after Ericka comes up to Pony with Jim Buck. “Mr. Buck here says you have 3 of the 4 golden horseshoes. May I see them?” Pony takes out the 3 from her pocket. Ericka looks at them, “They are beautiful but sorry, I don’t have any like that.” 
    “Sorry for bothering you then.“ Buck says
    “No problem” Ericka says and leaves
    Teagan is standing behind the 3 of them (Buck, Pony, and Tom) “I wonder what the murder was about.”
    Buck spots the King’s Journal in Tom’s pocket “What’s that you got there?” he says pointing to the book.
    Tom takes it out to show Buck. Buck speaks again “do you know what that really is?”
    “No, sir”
    “It is a journal the king told while he was taking care of Lela. It even has the war over the Enhancement Ring. That was what they called the Ever Diamond back then. Perhaps it is best if you all read it separately of paired but no more, I’ll tell you later why. Pony and Tom are you first?” they nod and go their room.

    This is Lela’s life story told by King Albert and written by the King’s scribe.

    Scientist have just discovered what Cosmin’s abilities are: Enhanced speed; semi-flying ability; some element control. My little girl may be the best in the kingdom.

    May 12, 2003
    Lela retrieves the Ever Diamond from the king’s tomb there she if reminded of the last words her father told her, “You should find the Holy Time Charm and undo all of this mess.”

    April 30, 2006
    An old man by the name of Bill Jones was caught in Millie’s barn (Lela’s horse) stabbing it like a savage. Lela drove the demons form the man but the horse died. Before the demons fled, they yelled out for “blood”.
    Pony and Tom look at each other. Pony says, “that’s why she killed him, but I never knew she ever had a horse.”
    “Maybe we could call it self-defense and Lela does free.”
    “We’ll talk it over after everyone reads this.”
    Next is Brittany and Cassie…
    After reading
    Brittany says, “Cosmin also has the ability to change the terrain using the 4 elements: ~”
    Cassie cuts in, “Wind, Water, Earth and Fire. But she’s also a princess, it never said the King had any other kids.”
    Jaimee comes inside from the porch, Brittany hands Jaimee the book, “You and Teagan’s turn.”
    “I want to read it too.” Ericka says. The three pair up and read the book.
    “The Ever Diamond was really a magical mistake but to save their head they presented it to the king anyway.” Ericka tells them. “She was also the last to study teletimer magic. I believe she got here by teleporting through time, but first before we go on about the discussion it is lunch time.”

    THIRTY-ONE
    About 3:00pm they finish lunch and begin talking about what they are to do next…
    They sit at a table (Teagan, Pony, Tom, Buck, Jaimee, Cassie, Brittany, and Ericka)
    Pony is at the table with her 3 horseshoes.
    Buck speaks, “Now that you have all read the journal you should share what you have learned.”
    They all start chattering at once. From the corner a large man is listening and spots Pony’s horse shoes. He walks over and taps her shoulder. She turns to him, and with close examination she guesses he’s in his 60’s. “I see you have the 3 lost horse shoes.”
    “But I thought there were 4!”
    “There are, but one is not lost. I’s sure my days of adventure are beyond over and I don’t need my gear. You have succeeded in finding these 3 you earn this.” He hands her a sword that is red handle with black etching throughout, black blade except the edge which is diamond coated chrome. It has an extraordinary luster to it all over.
    “I can’t accept this.”
    “You already have.”
    Truthfully, she already had, it was in her hand.’
    He continues, “One favor before you choose you horse, this sword was made to get my revenge on Lela for getting me kicked out of the king’s castle. I want you to see to it that its tack is done.” He reached behind his back and like a magic trick he pulls out the 4th horseshoe she takes it gratefully.
    “Thank you, sir.”
    “Stallion, and if you need help with training just call out.” And he fades leaving a mist of water.
    The 4 horseshoes begin to glow a golden light, and a voice spoke to her, but in her head, “Name your horse.” She thought for a moment and called out “Firestar!”
    Before her stood the small colt. The horseshoes shoot themselves into the horse and intense light blinds Pony. After the light stops the estimates the horse to be 20hh (1 hands high(hh) is 4in) This was way beyond normal, even for a Shire. All around the air it was covered with a gold glitter that never seemed to fall. Her friends were nowhere to be seen.

    THIRTY-TWO
    Chapter IV
    Stallion is standing there with a walking stick in hand, “But before I let you go, there is a specific item I would like back, my key. This allows me to see proof that you have defeated Lela.” He taps the place they stand with his stick and the room reappears before them. “Find and return my key to me.”
    “What do you think Pony?” Tom asked her.
    She turns to him. “Do what?”
    “We were talking about the Journal, what do you think?”
    She looks over her shoulder, but Stallion wasn’t there.” I think Lela helped create the Ever Diamond.” And they all started chatting again.

    THIRTY-THREE
    In the interrogation room Lela is being questioned…
    Bo is pacing back and forth alongside the table. “I hear you’re a trouble-maker, is this true?”
    Lela looks up with a dumbfound face. “Who? Me, a trouble-maker, that’s nonsense.”
    “Alright we’ll go with that, now who killed Bill?”
    “Suicide maybe?”
    “No, not buying it.”
    “I’m not selling.”
    Bo stops and leans over the table, “do you know the murder sentence?”
    “Not really.” In a simple voice that showed no concern. “But is there a sentence for liking the po-po boy?”
    “If you touch me, I promise to make one up special for you, with your name on it.”
    Lela leans closer to him until they almost touch, “What’s wrong? Did I hit a soft spot?”
    “You should know your place.” He straightens up and restarts questioning. “Where were you last night?”
    “At the inn.” A short quick answer.
    “What were you doing at the inn?”
    “I can in about 5 or so and bad a drink or two, guess I got drunk and passed out about 8 or 9. Woke up about 5 this morning.”
    Another officer comes in, “good enough, Lela, your free to go. But before you do…”

    THIRTY-FOUR
    Back at the inn…
    Ericka is rambling on about something on magic, but they don’t seem to be listening. Instead, they’re talking and trading ideas between themselves. Cassie is handing a ring with the infinity symbol on it, “Could you see if this has any enchantments on it?”
    “Sure.” She takes out a rolled scroll and taps the ring with either end, then opens it.
    “It’s blank, like completely, not even what kind of ring it is.”
    “Maybe it’s a new kind of ring.”
    “Where did you get it?” Brittany asks.
    “I found it where Lela was sitting least night.”
    “It’s kinda heavy. What’s it made out of?”
    Cassie picks it up and weights it her hand, “I’s say platinum. Worth about $900 easy!”
    “You’re joking.”
    “No, which is why I wonder where she got it from. Yeah, I know she’s rich but that’s a bit much, even for her.”

    THIRTY-FIVE
    Lela comes walking in…
    “Hey Lela. How did it go?” Cassie asks. All stop chatting and look at her.
    She sits and begins, “They found me guilty. But offered pardon, they said he had multiple counts of manslaughter.”
    “Lela, is this yours?” Brittany asks, showing her the ring.
    Taking it in her hand, “Yes, but I don’t want it.”
    “In that case, I want it!” Pony speaks up.
    “Have it.” and Lela tosses it over to her.
    A man about 5’ comes running in dressed in a blackish robe with a hood, “Dragon, here.” He seemed foreign. Some get up to the window and see. Ericka, Lela, Buck, and Pony run out where a leather hide dragon (a leather hide dragon is about 10ft, without wings) is being fought off by some peasants.
    Buck was the first to arrive to the dragon, he stabbed its hind leg with Diablo’s Knife, and it let out a roar of pain. The dragon swings its tail as him and knocks him back against the wall, knocking him out. Ericka and Lela reach him next, while Pony hesitates on to go or not.
    Ericka casts a homing beacon (a homing beacon will allow the caster to teleport to where it was set quickly) at the steps of the inn.

    THIRTY-SIX
    Jaimee runs over to the dragon and jumps on its back. Quickly as possible she draws her sword and jabs it into its shoulder. It rears up, knocking Jaimee off dropping her sword, scrambling to her fee the dragon turns and bites at Jaimee, but just before it can Lela calls out, “Dismiss Jaimee.” And she disappears.
    Pony grabs Stallion’s sword and magically it grants heroism (heroism prevents the person from being afraid), also Firestar appears before her. She gets on and starts toward the dragon…
    …Jaimee’s sword catches her eye, but before she could get to it the dragon steps on it, breaking it to pieces, but a small red glow becomes visible…

    THIRTY-SEVEN
    …Lela is making a distraction of herself by aimlessly swinging Cosmin around as the dragon sways with every move to keep from being hit in the face.
    …With the dragon moving away Pony is able to get the feather that is glowing red, when back on Firestar it sets its self o fire and creates wings of fire on the horse, also gaining 2 more hh (or 8 inches taller). The main and rail become as fire as well, changing its status from Lord Warhorse (Lord Warhorse is the 3rd rank in Warhorses) to Fire War Pegasus (this is the 4th rank). (the feathers as well are fiery) Firestar out stretches his wings and drops its head as if to charge. The dragon (in defense) tries to bite at the horse, but Firestar rears up and strikes the dragon’s face. The dragon is knocked over, scrambles up, and runs off, slamming into Firestar on the way.
    The hit makes the Ever Diamond fall off Pony’s belt and fall to the found. Ericka saw that the horse’s trampling would destroy the ring so she ran out, risking being trampled herself. Luckly enough she managed to get the ring but the horse was about to trample her. She called out “Home: and she teleported to the inn.
    The villagers cheered as Buck came to, and then the foreigner (maybe Chinese now that there was light to see). Came to them and said “He’s done now, but later he come back. You start, you finish, follow dragon and kill dragon.”
    “Where is it going?” 
    “Don’t be silly! You see, you know.”
    “Hey Buck, What’s out where?”
    “Nothing. It’s a wasteland, nothing grows.”
    “Then why would he retreat in that direction?” Tom asks.
    “I don’t know,” Buck replies “and I don’t intend to find out.”
    “What? You’re not going with us?”
    “No.”
    The Chinese man holds out a bow, here, you take my bow, you need it, I don’t.”
    Tom accepts it and massive quiver of arrows.
    “On the other side is my friend Elden. Go see him, he can help.”
    “Help with what?”
    “We all saw the Ever Diamond. It not secret.”
    Lela comes form the back of the crowd, “Sorry, I won’t be coming either, which puts Pony in charge.”
    “What!” Tom says with great disbelief.
    “She’s the highest in rank.”
    Pony, now aside Firestar stroking his neck, “In that case the sooner the better. I want everyone to have enough weapons to start a mini-war.”
    At this everyone scatters, grabbing everything that might bring harm to a dragon. A few villagers join in at grabbing equipment and assembling near the west gate. About an hour later about 25 to 30 people were in the group ready to fight the dragons.
    Everyone was chatting and saying good-bye to the families.
    Pony calls for silence and everyone stops to listen.
    “Soon we will be departing for the west, once we leave there will be no turning back, now’s the chance to stay.”
    5 or 6 guys who were not well-equipped leave the crowd quietly.
    Over on the other side 3 guys were bargaining over their equipment.
    In the front a man with ranged clothes is equipped with only a Pickknife.
    “Alright, let’s move out.” Some make to the stables for horse others just begin walking. Firestar kneels for Pony to get on.


    Part II War of the West
    Chapter V
    They came upon the dragon within the next hour. The wasteland had a desert climate but without so much sand, instead the ground was hard. Now that Pony could clearly see the man with the Pickknife he was very short maybe 3 ½ ft. tall and didn’t have much more than bones on his body. He seemed to know that he’s small though, because he was ridding a Shetland pony. He pulled if off his belt, and many others drew swords. Tom drew his bow and waited; Pony got off and ran Firestar from battle. She pulled Srallion’s Creation from her back, held it up and started the charge. Tom released the arrow; (being his first) he missed.
