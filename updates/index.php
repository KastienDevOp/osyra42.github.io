<blockquote>
- added image examples for vtuber models<br>
- removed premade shop as it don't really make sense to advertise all services to users that may only want one service, and the examples would be to similar to each service individually<br>
- change the website to zippocat.com so it is easier to remember<br>
- changed the business email to osyra42@zippocat.com<br>
- reorganized the nav bar to be a little cleaner, everything is under the commissions as that is the primary menu

- Fixed the update logbook to have a similar theme with the rest of the website. I hope you like it and enjoy the new look.<br>
- Fixed all dead links so that you can always share information, details in the Logbook will not have updated links as the are history and will instead have crossed out links.<br>
- shop items are now on the 3D Prints as they are really examples and not really specific things to buy.<br>
- books need to be repaired again but it will be more in tune with the website's well established theme<br>
- Navbar has been reworked, Commissions will be all the things that you can pay for while Projects are Passion Projects

everything changed on this website I am sorry but I did not keep up with all the changes. The main changes are using html5UP Landed theme, you will remember this theme from 2 years ago. I added all the shop and projects on the same site here. I am still adding the books to this site here. Please give me a few more weeks to continue pushing to the database. Maybe if you are good you might get something from my $tash.
