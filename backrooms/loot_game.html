    <h2>Enemies</h2>
    <pre>
  there will be enemies in the game
  enemies will be placed on teh level based on the values of a heat map
  the heat map will have more value fluctuation if the player has a certain amount of items
  the heat map will also determine the difficulty of the enemies
  if the heat map value goes to high the enemies will be mini-bosses
  mini-bosses will have extra abilities
    - for example they can have magic to cast
    - they can have a special attack
    - they will always have minions
    - they will always drop loot with a value above 50

  all dead enemies will remain on the map

</pre
    >

    <h2>Bosses</h2>
    <pre>
  major bosses will have a higher chance of spawning if not encountered in previous levels
  bosses will have a higher chance of spawning if the player has a certain amount of items

</pre
    >

    <h2>Dungeons</h2>
    <pre>
  the dungeon will be randomly generated
  there will be a map of the dungeon
  the theme of the dungeon will be randomly chosen but have higher weights for the season
    - spring will have a higher change of forest
    - summer will have a higher change of volcano
    - fall will have a higher change of desert
    - winter will have a higher change of snow
  the dungeon will have a random number of rooms
  each room will have a random number of doors
  each room will have a random number of items
  each item will have a random number of properties
  items will start with a hidden loot value and will be used like a data pool
   - the loot value will be used to determine the item's rarity
   - the loot value will be weighted to be lower
   - item properties cost loot value to be used
   - new random properties will be added to the item until it goes over the loot value,
    - dungeons will use various algorithms to determine the layout of the dungeon
    - rooms of interests will be added to the dungeon
    - the dungeon will have a boss at the end
    - the levels will have tons of clutter that is breakable
    - the levels will have traps that will cause the player to lose health
    - the levels will have traps that will cause the player to lose items
    - dungeons will be the only place that magical items can be found
   it will then keep the last property if it does not go over by more than, otherwise it's removed
      - 10 * (100 - loot value) / 100 + loot value + player level
      - 10 * (100 - 10) / 100 + 10 + 1 = 
      - 10 * 90 / 100 + 10 + 1 =
      - 900 / 100 + 10 + 1 =
      - 9 + 10 + 1 =
      - 20
    this will cause diminishing returns on the loot values
    this will allow a steel uncommon sword

   - the item will then be available for looting
   in this example, an item of a loot value of 10
    - uncommon
    - has a chance of being a weapon (sword)
    - weapon enchantments that cost less than 10
      - fast attack (made of aluminum) costs 6 loot value
      - knockback (made of iron) costs 8 loot value
      - sharpness (made of steel) costs 12 loot value
      - bleed chance costs 2 loot value and it stacks
      This means you could get a sword with fast attack (6) and bleed 2x (2x2=4) for a cost of 10 loot value, but if it
