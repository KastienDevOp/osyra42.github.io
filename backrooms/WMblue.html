<h1>WMblue</h1>
<h2>Step 1</h2>
Using Android Studio create an overlay app that simply says "Hello World" in the top left corner of the screen.
Use monospace font and black color. The app will require draw over permissions. Prompt user for permission access.


<h2>Step 2</h2>
Add a overlay button on the lower left corner of the screen.
This button will be round, yellow with a database icon in black.


<h2>Step 3</h2>
The notification bar will have a show / hide overlay button.
When clicked, the overlay will be toggled on or off.


<h2>Step 4</h2>
The overlay will scan a specific area of the screen for a UPC number.
If it finds one it will display it in the text field. If it doesn't find one, it will display a message saying "No UPC found".
Additionally add manual when the button is long pressed. This allows the user to scan screenshots.


<h2>Step 5</h2>
A database will be created to store the UPC numbers. The database will have the following fields:
- epoch time (int)
- UPC number (int)
- was printed (bool)
print will always be false until the print function is called
if the print function is called the most recent scan will be marked as printed
The database will be displayed in a table format when the button is pressed.


<h2>Step 6</h2>
The database table screen will have it's own menu bar at the top. The menu bar will have the following options:
- Clear all entries (Are you sure?)
- Select scan area (int, int)
- select scan delay (int)
- color glow (hex)
images can be added to the menu bar on buttons then the current settings will be displayed in the menu bar


<h2>Step 7</h2>
When a UPC is tapped, the upc is added to the clipboard.
When a new scan is preformed, a check will be made to see if the upc is in the database
and if it is it will also check is it was printed, if it was previously printed a subtle color glow will be added to the side of the screen.


<h2>Step 8</h2>
Change the scanner from scan frequency to only if the camera was just closed. 


<h2>Step 9</h2>
Here are some screenshots to test the app with
