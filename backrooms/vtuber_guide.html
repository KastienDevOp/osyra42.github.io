    This is for extremely low end devices. I do not personally have much skill drawing but I can show you a few tools that can help you draw.

THIS IS THE DEFAULT METHOD

    First, to make this way easier, you should have a reference image of your character. I recommend using a photo of your character from somewhere like <a href="https://www.pixiv.net">Pixiv</a> or <a href="https://www.deviantart.com">DeviantArt</a>. You can also use a picture of a character from a game or anime. This will mostly help get the colors correct.
    
    Download and install Vroid Studio, you can also get this on steam for free. <a href="https://vroid.com/en">VRoid Studio</a>
    It will be easiest to use this program like a video game character creation. There are also lots of assets on <a href="https://booth.pm/en">Booth.pm</a> where some are paid and some are free. Whe you are done remember to save a .vroid file but also export a .vrm file. The .vrm file is the one you will need for the next step.

    Now you need a tool that will use motion capture.
        Free <a href="https://www.vseeface.icu">VSeeFace</a>
          Requires a webcam.

        Free <a href="https://malaybaku.github.io/VMagicMirror/en/">VMagicMirror</a>
          Does not require a webcam.
