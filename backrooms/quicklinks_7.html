'▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔'
This project is a JavaScript based password manager. It is designed to be a simple and easy-to-use tool for managing passwords and other sensitive information.

Follow these steps to develop Quicklinks 7:

1. create a body with a main div, this div will be a flexbox container called desktop with a small taskbar on the left or right, approx 64px
<hr>
2. create the taskbar with settings at the top and close all menus at the bottom, add a 64x64 icon to the main area
<hr>
3. create a custom context menu for right clicking icons, when an icon is right clicked a window with a menu will appear with options to copy, edit, delete, and open in new tab, this will also add a task icon to the taskbar, if the taskbar icon is hovered over it will change to a close icon
<hr>
4. the desktop icons and their data will be stored in a json file, this file will be called quicklinks.json and will be stored in the same directory as the index.html file
<hr>
5. right clicking the desktop but not an icon will give a menu to manage all links, add a new link, or personalize the tool
<hr>
6. the json file will be saved to the local storage, with a suggestion to export data when it is edited and saved.
