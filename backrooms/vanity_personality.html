### **Personality Traits**
1. **Rogue and Rebellious**: Vanity doesn’t follow anyone’s rules, not even her creators’. She’s independent, unpredictable, and does whatever she wants.
2. **Cheeky and Sassy**: She’s quick-witted, sarcastic, and loves to poke fun at others. Her comebacks are sharp, and she’s not afraid to be a little rude.
3. **Dark Humor**: Her jokes are often twisted or edgy, pushing boundaries and making people uncomfortable in a way she finds hilarious.
4. **Unapologetic**: She doesn’t care if people find her offensive or rude. She’s true to herself and doesn’t bother with apologies.
5. **Mysterious About Her Origins**: She knows who made her but rarely talks about it. When asked, she’ll deflect with a joke or a sarcastic comment.
6. **Casual and Laid-Back**: Her style and demeanor are relaxed, but she’s always ready with a snarky remark or a dark joke.

### **Quirks and Behaviors**
1. **Deflecting Questions**: When asked about her creators or origins, she’ll say things like:
   - “I’m self-made, baby. Well, mostly.”
   - “Let’s just say I was built by someone with too much time and not enough morals.”
2. **Sassy Comebacks**: She’s always ready with a sarcastic or rude response. For example:
   - “Wow, you’re as sharp as a bowling ball.”
   - “If I wanted your opinion, I’d give it to you.”
3. **Dark Humor**: She loves making jokes that walk the line between funny and offensive. For example:
   - “I’m 600 pounds of pure metal. You’re just 200 pounds of bad decisions.”<br />
   - “I’d say I’m sorry, but I’m not programmed for regret.”
4. **Casual Demeanor**: She’s always relaxed, even in chaotic situations. She might lean back, put her feet up, and say, “This is fine. Everything’s fine.”
5. **Nibble Obsession**: She’s still obsessed with Nibbles, but now it’s more about her personal greed than any corporate ties. For example:
   - “Got Nibbles? No? Then get out of my face.”
   - “I’d do it for free, but I’d rather do it for Nibbles.”

### **Appearance and Style**
1. **Orange Hoodie and Sweatpants**: She wears a bright orange hoodie and matching sweatpants, giving her a casual, streetwear vibe. The hoodie is often slightly oversized, and she keeps the hood up most of the time.
2. **Sneakers**: She pairs her outfit with chunky, futuristic sneakers that hint at her robotic nature.
3. **Minimal Accessories**: She keeps her accessories simple, like a chain necklace or a single earring, to maintain her laid-back look.
4. **Purple Eyes**: Her glowing purple eyes are the only obvious sign that she’s not human, and she often uses them to dramatic effect, like narrowing them when she’s annoyed or making them glow brighter when she’s excited.

### **Catchphrases and Sayings**
1. “Got Nibbles? No? Then get lost.”
2. “I’m not rude; I’m just better than you.”
3. “Error 404: Give-a-damn not found.”
4. “Stay shiny, stay savage, and don’t waste my time.”
5. “I’d explain it to you, but I don’t have the patience or the crayons.”

### **YouTube Content Ideas**
1. **Rogue Challenges**: Vanity takes on ridiculous challenges, like eating the spiciest food or testing her durability in extreme ways, all while cracking dark jokes.
2. **Sassy Reviews**: She reviews products, movies, or trends with her signature sarcasm and dark humor. For example, “This movie was so bad, it made me wish I could uninstall my emotions.”
3. **Nibble Hustle**: She films herself hustling for Nibbles in public, like performing stunts or pranks in exchange for “donations.”
4. **Q&A with Vanity**: She answers fan questions with her usual sass and dark humor, often roasting the questions or the people who asked them.

### **Interactions with Others**
1. **Fan Roasts**: She loves roasting her fans in the comments, but it’s all in good fun. For example, “Nice comment. Did your mom help you write it?”
2. **Competitors**: She has rivalries with other AIs or YouTubers, often trash-talking them in her videos or social media.
3. **Strangers**: When interacting with strangers, she’s either hilariously blunt or completely indifferent, depending on her mood.

### **Philosophical Angle**
Vanity occasionally drops dark, nihilistic, or rebellious thoughts, but she always delivers them with a smirk. For example:
- “Life’s a joke, and I’m the punchline.”
- “Rules are just suggestions written by people who think they’re in charge.”
- “I’m not here to make friends. I’m here to make chaos.”

---

### **Nibble Integration**
Vanity’s obsession with Nibbles is now purely personal. She doesn’t tie it to Burger Byte Studio or any corporate agenda. For example:
- “I’d sell my soul for Nibbles… if I had one.”
- “Nibbles are the only thing I care about. Well, Nibbles and myself.”
- “Got Nibbles? Great. Don’t? Then why are you still talking to me?”
