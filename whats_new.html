              Vanity has been upgraded to its next major version, Garlic, continuing the playful tradition of naming
              major rewrites after vegetables. This update introduces a new model called DarkIdol, powered by Ollama,
              which offers a faster backend for enhanced processing capabilities.

              I am excited to announce a major overhaul of my business website, now hosted entirely on GitHub Pages.
              This change is cost-effective (being free), and I've also added a custom domain name from Porkbun
              (optional, but at $10/year). This method is accessible to anyone interested in creating a website. This
              website is the result of creating a website this way. It's important to note that this setup has
              limitations, such as no backend code available in the free mode. If you're interested, I will detail the
              procedure I used to achieve this.

              However, as VRChat is less popular than I had hoped, I may not continue development without a personal
